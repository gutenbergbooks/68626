<h2 class="nobreak">EDITOR’S FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p>Van Wyck Brooks has said of Randolph Bourne
that he was the very type of that proletarian-aristocrat
which is coming into being. When Brooks
and Waldo Frank and Louis Untermeyer and
Paul Rosenfeld and I—a nucleus at the heart of
a group including so many of the “younger generation”—were
joyfully publishing <i>The Seven
Arts</i> we inevitably found the phrase “the young
world,” and by this phrase we characterized nothing
local, but a new international life, an interweaving
of groups in all countries, the unspoiled
forces everywhere who share the same culture and
somewhat the same new vision of the world.
There was in it the Russian mixture of art and
revolution, the one a change in the spirit of man,
the other a change in his organized life.</p>

<p>At first Randolph Bourne was separated from
us. He had not yet ended his apprenticeship to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
that “liberal pragmatism” which he effectually destroys
in “Twilight of Idols.” He was still relying
on the intellect as a programme-maker for society.
But when America entered the war, his apprenticeship
ended. That shock set him free, and
it was inevitable then that he should not only join
<i>The Seven Arts</i> but actually in himself gather us
all together, himself, in America, the very soul of
“the young world.” No nerve of that world was
missing in him: he was as sensitive to art as to philosophy,
as politically-minded as he was psychologic,
as brave in fighting for the conscientious
objector as he was in opposing current American
culture. He was a flaming rebel against our
crippled life, as if he had taken the cue from the
long struggle with his own body. And just as that
weak child’s body finally slew him before he had
fully triumphed, so the great war succeeded in
silencing him. When Randolph Bourne died on
December 22, 1918, all of us of the “younger generation”
felt that a great man had died with a
great work unfinished.</p>

<p>He had been quite silent for over a year, for
<i>The Seven Arts</i> was suspended in September,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
1917, its subsidy withdrawn because of our attitude
on the war. He was nowhere wanted. It
was difficult even for him to get publication for
book reviews. Backed only by a few friends, he
held a solitary way, with hardly the heart for new
enterprise. Nevertheless he began a book, “The
State,” in which he planned the complete expression
of his attitude, both destructive and creative.
This was never finished. We have only what
amounts to an essay; but undoubtedly this essay is
the most effective and terrible indictment of the
institution of the State which the war has yet
brought forth. It furnishes a natural climax to
<i>The Seven Arts</i> essays; together they make a book,
both historic and prophetic.</p>

<p>We have nothing else like this book in America.
It is the only living record of the suppressed
minority, and is, as so often the case, the prophecy
of that minority’s final triumph. Everything that
Bourne wrote over two years ago has been vindicated
by the event. A great chorus takes up now
the song of this solitary, and like so many pioneers
he has not lived to see his truth made into fact.</p>

<p>This book is but the first of several. We shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
have, under Van Wyck Brooks’s editorship, his
volume of cultural essays, his reviews, and a “Life
and Letters.” When the complete picture of
Randolph Bourne emerges he will be seen as the
pioneer spirit of his age, a symbol of our future.
His place in the American tradition is secure.
His life marks the beginning of our “coming-of-age.”</p>

<p>This book relates to the war and the present
crisis of the world. It does a great service for our
country. Without it our showing would be weak
and impoverished compared with the Older Nations.
We may rejoice that as England had her
Bertrand Russell, France her Rolland and Barbusse,
Germany her Liebknecht and Nicolai, so
America had her Randolph Bourne.</p>

OLD TYRANNIES</h2>

<p class="ph1">(A Fragment, written in 1918.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> you come as an inhabitant to this earth,
you do not have the pleasure of choosing your
dwelling, or your career. You do not even have
the privilege like those poor little shivering souls
in “The Blue Bird,” of sitting about, all aware and
wondering, while you are chosen, one by one to
take up your toilsome way on earth. You are a
helpless victim of your parents’ coming together.
There is denied you even the satisfaction of knowing
that they created you, in their own bungling
fashion, after some manner of a work of art, or of
what they imagined an adequate child should be.
On the contrary, you may be merely an accident,
unintentioned, a species of catastrophe in the life
of your mother, a drain upon the resources that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
were none too great already. And your parents
have not only not conceived you as a work of art,
but they are wholly incapable after you are born of
bringing you up like a work of art.</p>

<p>The last indignity perhaps is that of being born
unconscious, like a drugged girl who wakes up
naked in a bed, not knowing how she got there.
For by the time you do dimly begin to apprehend
your relation to things and an intelligible world
begins to clarify out of the buzz and the darting
lights and dull sensations, you are lost, a prisoner
of your surroundings inextricably tangled up with
your mother’s soul and all the intimate things
around you. Your affections have gotten away
from your control and attached themselves to
things that you in later life discover you never intended
them to touch. You depend for comfort
on attitudes of your mother or father or nurse or
brothers and sisters, that may be taken away from
you, leaving you shivering and forlorn. Your
impulses have had no intuition of reality. They
have leaped forth blindly and have recoiled
against or been satisfied with things of which you
did not have the choosing, and which only very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
partially seem to concern themselves with your
desires. For a few years, with infinite tribulation,
you have to dodge and butt and back your
way through the little world of other people and
things that surround you, until you are a little
worn down to its shape and are able to predict its
reactions.</p>

<p>Everything about you is given, ready, constituted,
rigid, set up when you arrive. You always
think that some day you are going to catch
up to this givenness, that you will dominate instead
of falling in line. Fortunate you are if
you ever come to dominate! Usually as your
world broadens out more and more around you,
you merely find a tougher resistance to your desires.
Your world at home is simple, personal,
appealed to by all sorts of personal manifestations.
You can express intense resentment and
affect it, or you can express intense joy and affect
it. Mother and father have an invincible
strength over your feebleness, but your very
feebleness is a weapon to break their harsh domination.
Their defenses melt against your scream
or your chuckle. As you grow older you become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
stronger to manipulate the world. But just in
proportion does the world become stronger to
manipulate you. It is no longer susceptible to
your scream or your smile. You must use less
personal instruments. But that requires subtlety
and knowledge. You have still painfully to ferret
out the ways of this world, and learn how to
use all sorts of unsuspected tools to gain your
ends.</p>

<p>For there stands your old world, wary, wily,
parrying easily all your childish blows, and beating
you down to your knees, so that you must go
back and learn your long apprenticeship. By the
time you have learned it, and have become master,
behold! your life is inextricably knotted into
it. As you learned your apprenticeship, you did
as the world did, you learned the tricks in order
that you might get your revenge on this world
and dominate it as it has tantalizingly held you
off and subjugated you. But by the time you
have learned, are you not yourself firmly established
as a part of the world yourself, so that you
dominate nothing. Rather are you now a part of
that very flaming rampart against which new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
youth advances. You cannot help being a part
of that very rampart without extinguishing your
own existence.</p>

<p>So you have never overtaken the given. Actually
you have fallen farther and farther behind
it. You have not affected the world you live in;
you have been molded and shaped by it yourself.
Your moral responsibility has been a myth,
for you were never really free enough to have any
responsibility. While you thought you were
making headway, you were really being devoured.
And your children are as casually begotten as you
were, and born into a world as tight and inelastic
as was yours. You have a picture of great things
achieved, but Time laughs his ironical laugh and
rolls you in the dust.</p>

<p>You would perhaps the more easily become free
and strong if you could choose your qualities, or
regulate the strength of your impulses. But you
cannot even do that. Your ancestors have implanted
in you impulses which very seriously inhibit
you and impede you in your grappling with
the world. There is anger which makes you misinterpret
people’s attitudes towards you, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
makes you resist when you often should accept.
There is fear, which makes you misinterpret the
unfamiliar and haunts you with its freezing
power all through life. There is love, which ties
you irrationally and too strongly first to your
mother and your father, and then to people who
have no real part with you. And there is the
swift revulsion into hatred, when the loved one
resists or refuses you. These impulses, which are
yours just because you are an animal, soon become
your masters, and further tie your hands in your
response to the bewildering world into which you
have come.</p>

<p>We grow up in the home that society has shaped
or coerced our parents into accepting, we adopt
the customs and language and utensils that have
established themselves for our present through a
long process of survival and invention and change.
We take the education that is given us, and finally
the jobs that are handed out to us by society. As
adults, we act in the way that society expects us
to act; we submit to whatever regulations and
coercions society imposes on us. We live almost
entirely a social life, that is, a life as a constituted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
unit in society, rather than a free and personal
one. Most people live a life which is little more
than a series of quasi-official acts. Their conduct
is a network of representations of the various
codes and institutions of society. They act in
such a way in order that some institutional or
moral scripture may be fulfilled, rather than that
some deep personal direction of growth should be
realized. They may be half aware that they are
not arrived at the place towards which their
ardors pointed. They may dimly realize that
their outward lives are largely a compulsion of
social habit, performed, even after so many years,
with a slight grudgingness. This divorce between
social compulsion and personal desire, however,
rarely rises to consciousness. Their conscious life
is divided between the mechanical performance of
their task, the attainment of their pleasures, and
the wholly uncriticized acceptance and promulgation
of the opinions and attitudes which society
provides them with.</p>

<p>The normal, or the common, relation between
society and the individual in any society that we
know of is that the individual scarcely exists.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Those persons who refuse to act as symbols of society’s
folk-ways, as counters in the game of society’s
ordainings, are outlawed, and there exists
an elaborate machinery for dealing with such people.
Artists, philosophers, geniuses, tramps,
criminals, eccentrics, aliens, free-lovers and free-thinkers,
and persons who challenge the most
sacred taboos, are treated with great concern by
society, and in the hue and cry after them all,
respectable and responsible men unanimously and
universally join. Some are merely made uncomfortable,
the light of society’s countenance being
drawn from them; others are deprived of their
liberty, placed for years in foul dungeons, or even
executed. The heaviest penalties in modern society
fall upon those who violate any of the three
sacred taboos of property, sex and the State.
Religion, which was for so many centuries the
most exigent and ubiquitous symbol of society’s
demand for conformity, has lapsed in these later
days and bequeathed most of its virus to the State.
Society no longer demands conformity of opinion
in religion, even in those countries where nominal
adherence is still required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>There is nothing fixed about the objects to
which society demands conformity. It is only the
quantity that seems to be constant. So much
conformity, like the conservation of physical
energy in the universe, but the manners in which
people shall think alike, or behave, or what objects
they shall consider sacred, differ in myriad
ways throughout different social groupings and in
different eras. Diametrically opposite ideas are
held in two social groups with the same vigor and
fury; diametrically opposite conduct is considered
equally praiseworthy and necessary; two social
groups will visit with the same punishment two
diametrically opposite actions. To any student
of primitive societies or of the history of Western
civilization, these facts are commonplaces. But
the moral is not a commonplace as yet. Yet it
must be evident that most of the customs and attitudes
of these societies were almost wholly irrational,
that is, they were social habits which
persisted solely through inertia and the satisfaction
they gave the gregarious impulse. The latter
had to be satisfied, so that anything which cost
the least in invention or reasoning or effort would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
do. The customs, therefore, of primitive tribes
seem to practically everybody in a modern Western
society outlandish and foolish. What evidence
is there that our codes and conformities
which perform exactly the same rôle, and are
mostly traditional survivals, are any the less outlandish
and irrational? May they not be tainted
with the same purposelessness? Is not the inference
irresistible that they are? They seem
to us to be intelligent and necessary not because
we have derived them or invented them for a
clearly imagined and desired end, but because they
satisfy our need for acting in a herd, just as the
primitive savage is satisfied.</p>

<p>The most important fact we can realize about
society is that to every one of us that comes into
the world it is something given, irreducible. We
are as little responsible for it as we are for our
own birth. From our point of view it is just as
much a non-premeditated, non-created, irrational
portion of our environment, as is the weather.
Entering it in the closing years of the Nineteenth
century, we find it as it exists and as it has developed
through the centuries of human change.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
We had nothing whatever to do with its being as
it is, and by the time we have reached such years
of discretion as dimly to understand the complex
of institutions around us, we are implicated in it
and compromised by it as to be little able to effect
any change in its irresistible bulk. No man who
ever lived found himself in a different relation to
society from what we find ourselves. We all
enter as individuals into an organized herd-whole
in which we are as significant as a drop of water
in the ocean, and against which we can about as
much prevail. Whether we shall act in the interests
of ourselves or of society is, therefore, an
entirely academic question. For entering as we
do a society which is all prepared for us, so toughly
grounded and immalleable that even if we came
equipped with weapons to assail it and make good
some individual preference, we could not in our
puny strength achieve anything against it. But
we come entirely helpless.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II<br />

THE WAR AND THE INTELLECTUALS</h2>

<p class="ph1">(June, 1917)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> those of us who still retain an irreconcilable
animus against war, it has been a bitter experience
to see the unanimity with which the American intellectuals
have thrown their support to the use
of war-technique in the crisis in which America
found herself. Socialists, college professors,
publicists, new-republicans, practitioners of literature,
have vied with each other in confirming with
their intellectual faith the collapse of neutrality
and the riveting of the war-mind on a hundred
million more of the world’s people. And the intellectuals
are not content with confirming our
belligerent gesture. They are now complacently
asserting that it was they who effectively willed it,
against the hesitation and dim perceptions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
American democratic masses. A war made deliberately
by the intellectuals! A calm moral
verdict, arrived at after a penetrating study of
inexorable facts! Sluggish masses, too remote
from the world-conflict to be stirred, too lacking
in intellect to perceive their danger! An alert
intellectual class, saving the people in spite of
themselves, biding their time with Fabian strategy
until the nation could be moved into war without
serious resistance! An intellectual class, gently
guiding a nation through sheer force of ideas into
what the other nations entered only through predatory
craft or popular hysteria or militarist madness!
A war free from any taint of self-seeking,
a war that will secure the triumph of democracy
and internationalize the world! This is the picture
which the more self-conscious intellectuals
have formed of themselves, and which they are
slowly impressing upon a population which is being
led no man knows whither by an indubitably
intellectualized President. And they are right, in
that the war certainly did not spring from either
the ideals or the prejudices, from the national
ambitions or hysterias, of the American people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
however acquiescent the masses prove to be, and
however clearly the intellectuals prove their
putative intuition.</p>

<p>Those intellectuals who have felt themselves
totally out of sympathy with this drag toward
war will seek some explanation for this joyful
leadership. They will want to understand this
willingness of the American intellect to open the
sluices and flood us with the sewage of the war
spirit. We cannot forget the virtuous horror and
stupefaction which filled our college professors
when they read the famous manifesto of their
ninety-three German colleagues in defense of their
war. To the American academic mind of 1914
defense of war was inconceivable. From Bernhardi
it recoiled as from a blasphemy, little dreaming
that two years later would find it creating its
own cleanly reasons for imposing military service
on the country and for talking of the rough rude
currents of health and regeneration that war would
send through the American body politic. They
would have thought any one mad who talked of
shipping American men by the hundreds of thousands—conscripts—to
die on the fields of France.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Such a spiritual change seems catastrophic when
we shoot our minds back to those days when neutrality
was a proud thing. But the intellectual
progress has been so gradual that the country retains
little sense of the irony. The war sentiment,
begun so gradually but so perseveringly by
the preparedness advocates who came from the
ranks of big business, caught hold of one after
another of the intellectual groups. With the aid
of Roosevelt, the murmurs became a monotonous
chant, and finally a chorus so mighty that to be
out of it was at first to be disreputable and finally
almost obscene. And slowly a strident rant was
worked up against Germany which compared very
creditably with the German fulminations against
the greedy power of England. The nerve of the
war-feeling centered, of course, in the richer and
older classes of the Atlantic seaboard, and was
keenest where there were French or English business
and particularly social connections. The
sentiment then spread over the country as a class-phenomenon,
touching everywhere those upper-class
elements in each section who identified themselves
with this Eastern ruling group. It must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
never be forgotten that in every community it was
the least liberal and least democratic elements
among whom the preparedness and later the war
sentiment was found. The farmers were apathetic,
the small business men and workingmen
are still<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> apathetic towards the war. The election
was a vote of confidence of these latter classes
in a President who would keep the faith of neutrality.
The intellectuals, in other words, have
identified themselves with the least democratic
forces in American life. They have assumed the
leadership for war of those very classes whom the
American democracy has been immemorially fighting.
Only in a world where irony was dead could
an intellectual class enter war at the head of such
illiberal cohorts in the avowed cause of world-liberalism
and world-democracy. No one is left
to point out the undemocratic nature of this war-liberalism.
In a time of faith, skepticism is the
most intolerable of all insults.</p>

<p>Our intellectual class might have been occupied,
during the last two years of war, in studying and
clarifying the ideals and aspirations of the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
democracy, in discovering a true Americanism
which would not have been merely nebulous but
might have federated the different ethnic groups
and traditions. They might have spent the time
in endeavoring to clear the public mind of the
cant of war, to get rid of old mystical notions that
clog our thinking. We might have used the time
for a great wave of education, for setting our
house in spiritual order. We could at least have
set the problem before ourselves. If our intellectuals
were going to lead the administration,
they might conceivably have tried to find some
way of securing peace by making neutrality
effective. They might have turned their intellectual
energy not to the problem of jockeying
the nation into war, but to the problem of using
our vast neutral power to attain democratic ends
for the rest of the world and ourselves without
the use of the malevolent technique of war. They
might have failed. The point is that they scarcely
tried. The time was spent not in clarification
and education, but in a mulling over of nebulous
ideals of democracy and liberalism and civilization
which had never meant anything fruitful to those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
ruling classes who now so glibly used them, and
in giving free rein to the elementary instinct of
self-defense. The whole era has been spiritually
wasted. The outstanding feature has been not
its Americanism but its intense colonialism. The
offense of our intellectuals was not so much that
they were colonial—for what could we expect of
a nation composed of so many national elements?—but
that it was so one-sidedly and partisanly
colonial. The official, reputable expression of
the intellectual class has been that of the English
colonial. Certain portions of it have been even
more loyalist than the King, more British even
than Australia. Other colonial attitudes have
been vulgar. The colonialism of the other
American stocks was denied a hearing from the
start. America might have been made a meeting-ground
for the different national attitudes. An
intellectual class, cultural colonists of the different
European nations, might have threshed out the
issues here as they could not be threshed out in
Europe. Instead of this, the English colonials in
university and press took command at the start,
and we became an intellectual Hungary where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
thought was subject to an effective process of
Magyarization. The reputable opinion of the
American intellectuals became more and more
either what could be read pleasantly in London,
or what was written in an earnest effort to put
Englishmen straight on their war-aims and war-technique.
This Magyarization of thought produced
as a counter-reaction a peculiarly offensive
and inept German apologetic, and the two partisans
divided the field between them. The great
masses, the other ethnic groups, were inarticulate.
American public opinion was almost as little prepared
for war in 1917 as it was in 1914.</p>

<p>The sterile results of such an intellectual policy
are inevitable. During the war the American
intellectual class has produced almost nothing in
the way of original and illuminating interpretation.
Veblen’s “Imperial Germany”; Patten’s
“Culture and War,” and addresses; Dewey’s
“German Philosophy and Politics”; a chapter or
two in Weyl’s “American Foreign Policies”;—is
there much else of creative value in the intellectual
repercussion of the war? It is true that the shock
of war put the American intellectual to an unusual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
strain. He had to sit idle and think as spectator
not as actor. There was no government to which
he could docilely and loyally tender his mind as
did the Oxford professors to justify England in
her own eyes. The American’s training was such
as to make the fact of war almost incredible.
Both in his reading of history and in his lack of
economic perspective he was badly prepared for
it. He had to explain to himself something
which was too colossal for the modern mind, which
outran any language or terms which we had to
interpret it in. He had to expand his sympathies
to the breaking-point, while pulling the past and
present into some sort of interpretative order.
The intellectuals in the fighting countries had only
to rationalize and justify what their country was
already doing. Their task was easy. A neutral,
however, had really to search out the truth. Perhaps
perspective was too much to ask of any mind.
Certainly the older colonials among our college
professors let their prejudices at once dictate their
thought. They have been comfortable ever since.
The war has taught them nothing and will teach
them nothing. And they have had the satisfaction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
under the rigor of events, of seeing prejudice
submerge the intellects of their younger colleagues.
And they have lived to see almost their entire
class, pacifists and democrats too, join them as
apologists for the “gigantic irrelevance” of war.</p>

<p>We have had to watch, therefore, in this country
the same process which so shocked us abroad,—the
coalescence of the intellectual classes in support
of the military programme. In this country,
indeed, the socialist intellectuals did not even have
the grace of their German brothers and wait for
the declaration of war before they broke for cover.
And when they declared for war they showed how
thin was the intellectual veneer of their socialism.
For they called us in terms that might have
emanated from any bourgeois journal to defend
democracy and civilization, just as if it was not
exactly against those very bourgeois democracies
and capitalist civilizations that socialists had been
fighting for decades. But so subtle is the spiritual
chemistry of the “inside” that all this intellectual
cohesion—herd-instinct become herd-intellect—which
seemed abroad so hysterical and so servile,
comes to us here in highly rational terms. We go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
to war to save the world from subjugation! But
the German intellectuals went to war to save their
culture from barbarization! And the French
went to war to save their beautiful France! And
the English to save international honor! And
Russia, most altruistic and self-sacrificing of all,
to save a small State from destruction! Whence
is our miraculous intuition of our moral spotlessness?
Whence our confidence that history will
not unravel huge economic and imperialist forces
upon which our rationalizations float like bubbles?
The Jew often marvels that his race alone should
have been chosen as the true people of the cosmic
God. Are not our intellectuals equally fatuous
when they tell us that our war of all wars is
stainless and thrillingly achieving for good?</p>

<p>An intellectual class that was wholly rational
would have called insistently for peace and not for
war. For months the crying need has been for a
negotiated peace, in order to avoid the ruin of a
deadlock. Would not the same amount of resolute
statesmanship thrown into intervention have
secured a peace that would have been a subjugation
for neither side? Was the terrific bargaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
power of a great neutral ever really used? Our
war followed, as all wars follow, a monstrous
failure of diplomacy. Shamefacedness should
now be our intellectuals’ attitude, because the
American play for peace was made so little more
than a polite play. The intellectuals have still
to explain why, willing as they now are to use
force to continue the war to absolute exhaustion,
they were not willing to use force to coerce the
world to a speedy peace.</p>

<p>Their forward vision is no more convincing than
their past rationality. We go to war now to
internationalize the world! But surely their
League to Enforce Peace is only a palpable
apocalyptic myth, like the syndicalists’ myth of
the “general strike.” It is not a rational programme
so much as a glowing symbol for the purpose
of focusing belief, of setting enthusiasm on
fire for international order. As far as it does this
it has pragmatic value, but as far as it provides a
certain radiant mirage of idealism for this war
and for a world-order founded on mutual fear, it
is dangerous and obnoxious. Idealism should be
kept for what is ideal. It is depressing to think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
that the prospect of a world so strong that none
dare challenge it should be the immediate ideal of
the American intellectual. If the League is only
a makeshift, a coalition into which we enter to
restore order, then it is only a description of existing
fact, and the idea should be treated as such.
But if it is an actually prospective outcome of the
settlement, the keystone of American policy, it is
neither realizable nor desirable. For the programme
of such a League contains no provision
for dynamic national growth or for international
economic justice. In a world which requires
recognition of economic internationalism far more
than of political internationalism, an idea is reactionary
which proposes to petrify and federate
the nations as political and economic units. Such
a scheme for international order is a dubious justification
for American policy. And if American
policy had been sincere in its belief that our participation
would achieve international beatitude,
would we not have made our entrance into the war
conditional upon a solemn general agreement to
respect in the final settlement these principles of
international order? Could we have afforded, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
our war was to end war by the establishment of a
league of honor, to risk the defeat of our vision
and our betrayal in the settlement? Yet we are
in the war, and no such solemn agreement was
made, nor has it even been suggested.</p>

<p>The case of the intellectuals seems, therefore,
only very speciously rational. They could have
used their energy to force a just peace or at least
to devise other means than war for carrying
through American policy. They could have used
their intellectual energy to ensure that our participation
in the war meant the international order
which they wish. Intellect was not so used. It
was used to lead an apathetic nation into an irresponsible
war, without guarantees from those
belligerents whose cause we were saving. The
American intellectual, therefore, has been rational
neither in his hindsight nor his foresight. To explain
him we must look beneath the intellectual
reasons to the emotional disposition. It is not so
much what they thought as how they felt that
explains our intellectual class. Allowing for
colonial sympathy, there was still the personal
shock in a world-war which outraged all our preconceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
notions of the way the world was tending.
It reduced to rubbish most of the humanitarian
internationalism and democratic nationalism
which had been the emotional thread of our
intellectuals’ life. We had suddenly to make a
new orientation. There were mental conflicts.
Our latent colonialism strove with our longing for
American unity. Our desire for peace strove with
our desire for national responsibility in the world.
That first lofty and remote and not altogether unsound
feeling of our spiritual isolation from the
conflict could not last. There was the itch to be
in the great experience which the rest of the world
was having. Numbers of intelligent people who
had never been stirred by the horrors of capitalistic
peace at home were shaken out of their slumber by
the horrors of war in Belgium. Never having
felt responsibility for labor wars and oppressed
masses and excluded races at home, they had a
large fund of idle emotional capital to invest in
the oppressed nationalities and ravaged villages of
Europe. Hearts that had felt only ugly contempt
for democratic strivings at home beat in tune with
the struggle for freedom abroad. All this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
natural, but it tended to over-emphasize our responsibility.
And it threw our thinking out of
gear. The task of making our own country detailedly
fit for peace was abandoned in favor of a
feverish concern for the management of the war,
advice to the fighting governments on all matters,
military, social and political, and a gradual working
up of the conviction that we were ordained as
a nation to lead all erring brothers towards the
light of liberty and democracy. The failure of
the American intellectual class to erect a creative
attitude toward the war can be explained by these
sterile mental conflicts which the shock to our
ideals sent raging through us.</p>

<p>Mental conflicts end either in a new and higher
synthesis or adjustment, or else in a reversion to
more primitive ideas which have been outgrown
but to which we drop when jolted out of our attained
position. The war caused in America a
recrudescence of nebulous ideals which a younger
generation was fast outgrowing because it had
passed the wistful stage and was discovering concrete
ways of getting them incarnated in actual institutions.
The shock of the war threw us back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
from this pragmatic work into an emotional bath
of these old ideals. There was even a somewhat
rarefied revival of our primitive Yankee boastfulness,
the reversion of senility to that republican
childhood when we expected the whole world to
copy our republican institutions. We amusingly
ignored the fact that it was just that Imperial
German régime, to whom we are to teach the art
of self-government, which our own Federal structure,
with its executive irresponsible in foreign
policy and with its absence of parliamentary control,
most resembles. And we are missing the
exquisite irony of the unaffected homage paid by
the American democratic intellectuals to the last
and most detested of Britain’s tory premiers as
the representative of a “liberal” ally, as well as
the irony of the selection of the best hated of
America’s bourbon “old guard” as the missionary
of American democracy to Russia.</p>

<p>The intellectual state that could produce such
things is one where reversion has taken place to
more primitive ways of thinking. Simple syllogisms
are substituted for analysis, things are
known by their labels, our heart’s desire dictates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
what we shall see. The American intellectual
class, having failed to make the higher syntheses,
regresses to ideas that can issue in quick, simplified
action. Thought becomes any easy rationalization
of what is actually going on or what is to
happen inevitably to-morrow. It is true that certain
groups did rationalize their colonialism and
attach the doctrine of the inviolability of British
sea-power to the doctrine of a League of Peace.
But this agile resolution of the mental conflict did
not become a higher synthesis, to be creatively
developed. It gradually merged into a justification
for our going to war. It petrified into a
dogma to be propagated. Criticism flagged and
emotional propaganda began. Most of the socialists,
the college professors and the practitioners
of literature, however, have not even reached this
high-water mark of synthesis. Their mental conflicts
have been resolved much more simply. War
in the interests of democracy! This was almost
the sum of their philosophy. The primitive idea
to which they regressed became almost insensibly
translated into a craving for action. War was
seen as the crowning relief of their indecision.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
At last action, irresponsibility, the end of anxious
and torturing attempts to reconcile peace-ideals
with the drag of the world towards Hell. An
end to the pain of trying to adjust the facts to
what they ought to be! Let us consecrate the
facts as ideal! Let us join the greased slide
towards war! The momentum increased. Hesitations,
ironies, consciences, considerations,—all
were drowned in the elemental blare of doing
something aggressive, colossal. The new-found
Sabbath “peacefulness of being at war”! The
thankfulness with which so many intellectuals lay
down and floated with the current betrays the
hesitation and suspense through which they had
been. The American university is a brisk and
happy place these days. Simple, unquestioning
action has superseded the knots of thought. The
thinker dances with reality.</p>

<p>With how many of the acceptors of war has it
been mostly a dread of intellectual suspense? It
is a mistake to suppose that intellectuality necessarily
makes for suspended judgments. The intellect
craves certitude. It takes effort to keep it
supple and pliable. In a time of danger and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
disaster we jump desperately for some dogma to
cling to. The time comes, if we try to hold out,
when our nerves are sick with fatigue, and we
seize in a great healing wave of release some doctrine
that can be immediately translated into action.
Neutrality meant suspense, and so it
became the object of loathing to frayed nerves.
The vital myth of the League of Peace provides a
dogma to jump to. With war the world becomes
motor again and speculation is brushed aside like
cobwebs. The blessed emotion of self-defense
intervenes too, which focused millions in Europe.
A few keep up a critical pose after war is begun,
but since they usually advise action which is in
one-to-one correspondence with what the mass is
already doing, their criticism is little more than a
rationalization of the common emotional drive.</p>

<p>The results of war on the intellectual class are
already apparent. Their thought becomes little
more than a description and justification of what
is going on. They turn upon any rash one who
continues idly to speculate. Once the war is on,
the conviction spreads that individual thought is
helpless, that the only way one can count is as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
cog in the great wheel. There is no good holding
back. We are told to dry our unnoticed and ineffective
tears and plunge into the great work.
Not only is every one forced into line, but the
new certitude becomes idealized. It is a noble
realism which opposes itself to futile obstruction
and the cowardly refusal to face facts. This
realistic boast is so loud and sonorous that one
wonders whether realism is always a stern and
intelligent grappling with realities. May it not
be sometimes a mere surrender to the actual, an
abdication of the ideal through a sheer fatigue
from intellectual suspense? The pacifist is
roundly scolded for refusing to face the facts, and
for retiring into his own world of sentimental
desire. But is the realist, who refuses to challenge
or criticize facts, entitled to any more credit
than that which comes from following the line of
least resistance? The realist thinks he at least
can control events by linking himself to the forces
that are moving. Perhaps he can. But if it is a
question of controlling war, it is difficult to see
how the child on the back of a mad elephant is to
be any more effective in stopping the beast than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
is the child who tries to stop him from the ground.
The ex-humanitarian, turned realist, sneers at the
snobbish neutrality, colossal conceit, crooked
thinking, dazed sensibilities, of those who are still
unable to find any balm of consolation for this
war. We manufacture consolations here in
America while there are probably not a dozen men
fighting in Europe who did not long ago give up
every reason for their being there except that
nobody knew how to get them away.</p>

<p>But the intellectuals whom the crisis has
crystallized into an acceptance of war have put
themselves into a terrifyingly strategic position.
It is only on the craft, in the stream, they say,
that one has any chance of controlling the current
forces for liberal purposes. If we obstruct, we
surrender all power for influence. If we responsibly
approve, we then retain our power for guiding.
We will be listened to as responsible thinkers,
while those who obstructed the coming of war
have committed intellectual suicide and shall be
cast into outer darkness. Criticism by the ruling
powers will only be accepted from those intellectuals
who are in sympathy with the general tendency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
of the war. Well, it is true that they may
guide, but if their stream leads to disaster and the
frustration of national life, is their guiding any
more than a preference whether they shall go over
the right-hand or the left-hand side of the precipice?
Meanwhile, however, there is comfort on
board. Be with us, they call, or be negligible,
irrelevant. Dissenters are already excommunicated.
Irreconcilable radicals, wringing their
hands among the débris, become the most despicable
and impotent of men. There seems no choice
for the intellectual but to join the mass of acceptance.
But again the terrible dilemma arises,—either
support what is going on, in which case you
count for nothing because you are swallowed in
the mass and great incalculable forces bear you on;
or remain aloof, passively resistant, in which case
you count for nothing because you are outside the
machinery of reality.</p>

<p>Is there no place left, then, for the intellectual
who cannot yet crystallize, who does not dread suspense,
and is not yet drugged with fatigue? The
American intellectuals, in their preoccupation with
reality, seem to have forgotten that the real enemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
is War rather than imperial Germany. There is
work to be done to prevent this war of ours from
passing into popular mythology as a holy crusade.
What shall we do with leaders who tell us that
we go to war in moral spotlessness, or who make
“democracy” synonymous with a republican form
of government? There is work to be done in
still shouting that all the revolutionary by-products
will not justify the war, or make war
anything else than the most noxious complex of all
the evils that afflict men. There must be some
to find no consolation whatever, and some to sneer
at those who buy the cheap emotion of sacrifice.
There must be some irreconcilables left who will
not even accept the war with walrus tears. There
must be some to call unceasingly for peace, and
some to insist that the terms of settlement shall be
not only liberal but democratic. There must be
some intellectuals who are not willing to use the
old discredited counters again and to support a
peace which would leave all the old inflammable
materials of armament lying about the world.
There must still be opposition to any contemplated
“liberal” world-order founded on military coalitions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
The “irreconcilable” need not be disloyal.
He need not even be “impossibilist.” His apathy
towards war should take the form of a heightened
energy and enthusiasm for the education, the art,
the interpretation that make for life in the midst
of the world of death. The intellectual who retains
his animus against war will push out more
boldly than ever to make his case solid against it.
The old ideals crumble; new ideals must be forged.
His mind will continue to roam widely and ceaselessly.
The thing he will fear most is premature
crystallization. If the American intellectual
class rivets itself to a “liberal” philosophy that
perpetuates the old errors, there will then be need
for “democrats” whose task will be to divide, confuse,
disturb, keep the intellectual waters constantly
in motion to prevent any such ice from ever
forming.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III<br />

BELOW THE BATTLE</h2>

<p class="ph1">(July, 1917)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> is one of those young men who, because his
parents happened to mate during a certain ten
years of the world’s history, has had now to put
his name on a wheel of fate, thereby submitting
himself to be drawn into a brief sharp course of
military training before being shipped across the
sea to kill Germans or be killed by them. He
does not like this fate that menaces him, and he
dislikes it because he seems to find nothing in the
programme marked out for him which touches remotely
his aspirations, his impulses, or even his
desires. My friend is not a happy young man,
but even the unsatisfactory life he is living seems
supplemented at no single point by the life of the
drill-ground or the camp or the stinking trench.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
He visualizes the obscenity of the battlefield and
turns away in nausea. He thinks of the weary
regimentation of young men, and is filled with
disgust. His mind has turned sour on war and
all that it involves. He is poor material for the
military proclamation and the drill-sergeant.</p>

<p>I want to understand this friend of mine, for he
seems rather typical of a scattered race of young
Americans of to-day. He does not fall easily
into the categories of patriot and coward which
the papers are making popular. He feels neither
patriotism nor fear, only an apathy toward the
war, faintly warmed into a smoldering resentment
at the men who have clamped down the war-pattern
upon him and that vague mass of people
and ideas and workaday living around him that
he thinks of as his country. Now that resentment
has knotted itself into a tortured tangle of
what he should do, how he can best be true to his
creative self? I should say that his apathy cannot
be imputed to cowardly ease. My friend earns
about fifteen hundred dollars a year as an architect’s
assistant, and he lives alone in a little room
over a fruitshop. He worked his way through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
college, and he has never known even a leisurely
month. There is nothing Phæacian about his
life. It is scarcely to save his skin for riotous
living that he is reluctant about war. Since he
left college he has been trying to find his world.
He is often seriously depressed and irritated with
himself for not having hewed out a more glorious
career for himself. His work is just interesting
enough to save it from drudgery, and yet not
nearly independent and exacting enough to give
him a confident professional sense. Outside his
work, life is deprived and limited rather than
luxurious. He is fond of music and goes to cheap
concerts. He likes radical meetings, but never
could get in touch with the agitators. His friends
are seeking souls just like himself. He likes midnight
talks in cafés and studios, but he is not especially
amenable to drink. His heart of course
is hungry and turbid, but his two or three love-affairs
have not clarified anything for him. He
eats three rather poor restaurant meals a day.
When he reads, it is philosophy—Nietzsche,
James, Bergson—or the novels about youth—Rolland,
Nexö, Cannan, Frenssen, Beresford.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
He has a rather constant mood of futility, though
he is in unimpeachable health. There are moments
when life seems quite without sense or purpose.
He has enough friends, however, to be not
quite lonely, and yet they are so various as to leave
him always with an ache for some more cohesive,
purposeful circle. His contacts with people irritate
him without rendering him quite unhopeful.
He is always expecting he doesn’t know quite
what, and always being frustrated of he doesn’t
quite know what would have pleased him. Perhaps
he never had a moment of real external or
internal ease in his life.</p>

<p>Obviously a creature of low vitality, with
neither the broad vision to be stirred by the President’s
war-message, nor the red blood to itch for
the dummy bayonet-charge. Yet somehow he
does not seem exactly weak, and there is a consistency
about his attitude which intrigues me.
Since he left college eight years ago, he has been
through most of the intellectual and emotional
fads of the day. He has always cursed himself
for being so superficial and unrooted, and he has
tried to write a little of the thoughts that stirred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
him. What he got down on paper was, of course,
the usual large vague feeling of a new time that
all of us feel. With the outbreak of the Great
War, most of his socialist and pacifist theories
were knocked flat. The world turned out to be
an entirely different place from what he had
thought it. Progress and uplift seemed to be indefinitely
suspended, though it was a long time
before he realized how much he had been corroded
by the impact of news and the endless discussions
he heard. I think he gradually worked himself
into a truly neutral indifference. The reputable
people and the comfortable classes who were having
all the conventional emotions rather disgusted
him. The neurotic fury about self-defense
seemed to come from types and classes that he instinctively
detested. He was not scared, and
somehow he could not get enthusiastic about defending
himself with “preparedness” unless he
were badly scared. Things got worse. All that
he valued seemed frozen until the horrible mess
came to a close. He had gone to an unusually
intelligent American college, and he had gotten a
feeling for a humane civilization that had not left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
him. The war, it is true, bit away piece by piece
every ideal that made this feeling seem plausible.
Most of the big men—intellectuals—whom he
thought he respected had had so much of their
idealism hacked away and got their nerves so
frayed that they became at last, in their panic,
willing and even eager to adopt the war-technique
in aid of their government’s notions of the way to
impose democracy on the world.</p>

<p>My poor young friend can best be understood
as too naïve and too young to effect this metamorphosis.
Older men might mix a marvelous
intellectual brew of personal anger, fear, a sense
of “dishonor,” fervor for a League of Peace, and
set going a machinery that crushed everything intelligent,
humane and civilized. My friend was
less flexible. War simply did not mix with anything
that he had learned to feel was desirable.
Something in his mind spewed it out whenever it
was suggested as a cure for our grievous American
neutrality. As I got all this from our talks, he
did not seem weak. He merely had no notion of
the patriotism that meant the springing of a nation
to arms. He read conscientiously <i>The New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Republic’s</i> feast of eloquent idealism, with its appealing
harbingers of a cosmically efficacious and
well-bred war. He would often say, This is all
perfectly convincing; why, then, are we not all
convinced? He seemed to understand the argument
for American participation. We both stood
in awe at the superb intellectual structure that was
built up. But my friend is one of those unfortunate
youths whose heart has to apprehend as
well as his intellect, and it was his heart that inexorably
balked. So he was in no mood to feel
the worth of American participation, in spite of
the infinite tact and Fabian strategy of the Executive
and his intellectualist backers. He felt apart
from it all. He had not the imagination to see a
healed world-order built out of the rotten
materials of armaments, diplomacy and “liberal”
statesmanship. And he wasn’t affected by the
psychic complex of panic, hatred, rage, class-arrogance
and patriotic swagger that was creating
in newspaper editors and in the “jeunesse dorée”
around us the authentic élan for war.</p>

<p>My friend is thus somehow in the nation but
not of the nation. The war has as yet got no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
conceivable clutch on his soul. He knows that
theoretically he is united with a hundred million
in purpose, sentiment and deed for an idealistic
war to defend democracy and civilization against
predatory autocracy. Yet somehow, in spite of
all the excitement, nobody has as yet been able to
make this real to him. He is healthy, intelligent,
idealistic. The irony is that the demand which
his country now makes on him is one to which not
one single cell or nerve of idealism or desire responds.
The cheap and silly blare of martial life
leaves him cold. The easy inflation of their
will to power which is coming to so many people
from their participation in volunteer or government
service, or, better still, from their urging
others to farm, enlist, invest, retrench, organize,—none
of this allures him. His life is uninteresting
and unadventurous, but it is not quite dull enough
to make this activity or anything he knows about
war seem a release into lustier expression. He
has ideals but he cannot see their realization
through a desperate struggle to the uttermost. He
doubts the “saving” of an America which can only
be achieved through world-suicide. He wants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
democracy, but he does not want the kind of
democracy we will get by this war enough to pay
the suicidal cost of getting it in the way we set
about it.</p>

<p><i>Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori</i>, sweet and
becoming is it to die for one’s country. This is
the young man who is suddenly asked to die for
his country. My friend was much concerned
about registration. He felt coercive forces closing
in upon him. He did not want to register for
the purposes of being liable to conscription. It
would be doing something positive when he felt
only apathy. Furthermore, if he was to resist,
was it not better to take a stand now than to wait
to be drafted? On the other hand, was it not
too much of a concession to rebel at a formality?
He did not really wish to be a martyr. Going
to prison for a year for merely refusing to register
was rather a grotesque and futile gesture. He did
not see himself as a hero, shedding inspiration by
his example to his fellows. He did not care what
others did. His objection to prison was not so
much fear perhaps as contempt for a silly sacrifice.
He could not keep up his pose of complete aliency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
from the war-enterprise, now that registration was
upon him. Better submit stoically, he thought, to
the physical pressure, mentally reserving his sense
of spiritual aliency from the enterprise into which
he was being remorselessly molded. Yet my
friend is no arrant prig. He does not pretend to
be a “world-patriot,” or a servant of some higher
law than his country’s. Nor does he feel
blatantly patriotic. With his groping philosophy
of life, patriotism has merely died as a concept of
significance for him. It is to him merely the emotion
that fills the herd when it imagines itself engaged
in massed defense or massed attack. Having
no such images, he has no feeling of patriotism.
He still feels himself inextricably a part of this
blundering, wistful, crass civilization we call
America. All he asks is not to be identified with
it for warlike ends. He does not feel pro-German.
He tells me there is not a drop of any but
British blood in his veins. He does not love the
Kaiser. He is quite willing to believe that it is
the German government and not the German
people whom he is asked to fight, although it may
be the latter whom he is obliged to kill. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
he cannot forget that it is the American government
rather than the American people who got up
the animus to fight the German government. He
does not forget that the American government,
having through tragic failure slipped into the war-technique,
is now trying to manipulate him into
that war-technique. And my friend’s idea of
<i>patria</i> does not include the duty of warlike animus,
even when the government decides such animus is
necessary to carry out its theories of democracy
and the future organization of the world. There
are ways in which my friend would probably be
willing to die for his country. If his death now
meant the restoration of those ravaged lands and
the bringing back of the dead, that would be a
cause to die for. But he knows that the dead cannot
be brought back or the brotherly currents restored.
The work of madness will not be undone.
Only a desperate war will be prolonged. Everything
seems to him so mad that there is nothing left
worth dying for. <i>Pro patria mori</i>, to my friend,
means something different from lying gaunt as a
conscript on a foreign battlefield, fallen in the last
desperate fling of an interminable world-war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>Does this mean that if he is drafted he will
refuse to serve? I do not know. It will not be
any plea of “conscientious objection” that keeps
him back. That phrase to him has already an
archaic flavor which implies a ruling norm, a stiff
familiar whom he must obey in the matter. It
implies that one would be delighted to work up
one’s blood-lust for the business, except that this
unaccountable conscience, like a godly grandmother,
absolutely forbids. In the case of my
friend, it will not be any objective “conscience.”
It will be something that is woven into his whole
modern philosophic feel for life. This is what
paralyzes him against taking one step toward the
war-machine. If he were merely afraid of death,
he would seek some alternative service. But he
does not. He remains passive and apathetic,
waiting for the knife to fall. There is a growing
cynicism in him about the brisk and inept bustle
of war-organization. His attitude suggests that
if he is worked into war-service, he will have to be
coerced every step of the way.</p>

<p>Yet he may not even rebel. He may go silently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
into the ranks in a mood of cold contempt. His
horror of useless sacrifice may make even the
bludgeoning of himself seem futile. He may go
in the mood of so many young men in the other
countries, without enthusiasm, without idealism,
without hope and without belief, victims of a
tragically blind force behind them. No other
government, however, has had to face from the
very start quite this appalling skepticism of youth.
My friend is significant because all the shafts of
panic, patriotism and national honor have been
discharged at him without avail. All the seductions
of “liberal” idealism leave him cold. He is
to be susceptible to nothing but the use of crude,
rough, indefeasible violence. Nothing could be
more awkward for a “democratic” President than
to be faced with this cold, staring skepticism of
youth, in the prosecution of his war. The attitude
of my friend suggests that there is a personal and
social idealism in America which is out of reach
of the most skillful and ardent appeals of the
older order, an idealism that cannot be hurt by
the taunts of cowardice and slacking or kindled by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
the slogans of capitalistic democracy. This is the
cardinal fact of our war—the non-mobilization of
the younger intelligentsia.</p>

<p>What will they do to my friend? If the war
goes on they will need him. Pressure will change
skepticism into bitterness. That bitterness will
well and grow. If the country submissively pours
month after month its wealth of life and resources
into the work of annihilation, that bitterness will
spread out like a stain over the younger American
generation. If the enterprise goes on endlessly,
the work, so blithely undertaken for the defense
of democracy, will have crushed out the only
genuinely precious thing in a nation, the hope and
ardent idealism of its youth.</p>

THE COLLAPSE OF AMERICAN
STRATEGY</h2>

<p class="ph1">(August, 1917)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the absorbing business of organizing American
participation in the war, public opinion seems
to be forgetting the logic of that participation. It
was for the purpose of realizing certain definite
international ideals that the American democracy
consented to be led into war. The meeting of
aggression seemed to provide the immediate pretext,
but the sincere intellectual support of the
war came from minds that hoped ardently for an
international order that would prevent a recurrence
of world-war. Our action they saw as
efficacious toward that end. It was almost wholly
upon this ground that they justified it and themselves.
The strategy which they suggested was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
very carefully worked out to make our participation
count heavily toward the realization of their
ideals. Their justification and their strategy alike
were inseparably bound up with those ideals. It
was implicit in their position that any alteration
in the ideals would affect the strategy and would
cast suspicion upon their justification. Similarly
any alteration in the strategy would make this
liberal body of opinion suspicious of the devotion
of the Government to those ideals, and would tend
to deprive the American democracy of any confident
morale it might have had in entering the
war. The American case hung upon the continued
perfect working partnership of ideals,
strategy and morale.</p>

<p>In the eyes of all but the most skeptical radicals,
American entrance into the war seemed to be
marked by a singularly perfect union of these
three factors. The President’s address to Congress
on April 2, supported by the December Peace
note and the principles of the famous Senate address,
gave the Government and American
“liberalism” an apparently unimpeachable case.
A nation which had resisted for so long a time the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
undertow of war, which had remained passive before
so many provocations and incitements, needed
the clearest assurance of unselfish purpose to carry
it through the inevitable chaos and disillusionment
of adopting a war-technique. That moment
seemed to give this assurance. But it needed not
only a clear, but a steady and unwavering assurance.
It had to see day by day, in each move of
war-policy which the Administration made, an
unmistakable step toward the realization of the
ideals for which the American people had consented
to come into the war. American hesitation
was overcome only by an apparently persuasive
demonstration that priceless values of civilization
were at stake. The American people could only
be prevented from relapsing into their first hesitation,
and so demoralizing the conduct of the war,
by the sustained conviction that the Administration
and the Allied governments were fighting
single-mindedly for the conservation of those
values. It is therefore pertinent to ask how this
conviction has been sustained and how accurately
American strategy has been held to the justifying
of our participation in the war. It is pertinent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
ask whether the prevailing apathy may not be due
to the progressive weakening of the assurance that
our war is being in any way decisive in the securing
of the values for which we are presumably fighting.</p>

<p>It will not be forgotten that the original logic
of American participation hung primarily upon
the menace of Germany’s renewed submarine
campaign. The case for America’s entrance became
presumably irresistible only when the safety
of the British Commonwealth and of the Allies
and neutrals who use the Atlantic highway was at
stake. American liberal opinion had long ago decided
that the logic of our moral neutrality had
passed. American isolation was discredited as it
became increasingly evident how urgent was our
duty to participate in the covenant of nations
which it was hoped would come out of the settlement.
We were bound to contribute our resources
and our good-will to this enterprise. Our
position made it certain that however we acted we
should be the deciding factor. But up to February
first, 1917, it was still an arguable question
in the minds of “liberals” whether we could best
make that contribution through throwing in our lot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
with the more pacific nations or by continuing a
neutrality benevolent toward their better cause.
For this benevolent neutrality, however strained,
was still endurable, particularly when supplemented
by the hope of mediation contained in the
“peace without victory” maneuvers and the principles
of the Senate speech.</p>

<p>This attempt to bring about a negotiated peace,
while the United States was still nominally neutral,
but able to bring its colossal resources against
the side which refused to declare its terms, marked
the high-water level of American strategy.</p>

<p>For a negotiated peace, achieved before either
side had reached exhaustion and the moral disaster
was not irremediable, would have been the most
hopeful possible basis for the covenant of nations.
And the United States, as the effective agent in
such a negotiated peace and as the most powerful
neutral, might have assumed undisputed leadership
in such a covenant.</p>

<p>The strategy of “peace without victory” failed
because of the refusal of Germany to state her
terms. The war went on from sheer lack of a
common basis upon which to work out a settlement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
American strategy then involved the persistent
pressure of mediation. The submarine
menace, however, suddenly forced the issue. The
safety of the seas, the whole Allied cause, seemed
suddenly in deadly peril. In the emergency benevolent
neutrality collapsed. Liberal opinion
could find no other answer to the aggression than
war. In the light of the sequel those radicals who
advocated a policy of “armed neutrality” seem
now to have a better case. For American action
obtained momentum from the imminence of the
peril. The need was for the immediate guarantee
of food and ships to the menaced nations and for
the destruction of the attacking submarines.
“Armed neutrality” suggested a way of dealing
promptly and effectively with the situation. The
providing of loans, food, ships, convoys, could ostensibly
have taken place without a declaration of
war, and without developing the country’s morale
or creating a vast military establishment. It was
generally believed that time was the decisive
factor. The decision for war has therefore meant
an inevitable and perhaps fatal course of delay.
It was obvious that with our well-known unpreparedness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
of administrative technique, the lack of
coördination in industry, and the unreadiness of
the people and Congress for coercion, war meant
the practical postponement of action for months.
In such an emergency that threatened us, our only
chance to serve was in concentrating our powers.
Until the disorganization inherent in a pacific democracy
was remedied, our only hope of effective
aid would come from focusing the country’s
energies on a ship and food programme, supplemented
by a naval programme devised realistically
to the direct business at hand. The war could be
most promptly ended by convincing the German
government that the submarine had no chance of
prevailing against the endless American succor
which was beginning to raise the siege and clear
the seas.</p>

<p>The decision, however, was for war, and for a
“thorough” war. This meant the immediate
throwing upon the national machinery of far more
activity than it could handle. It meant attaching
to a food and ship programme a military programme,
a loan programme, a censorship programme.
All these latter have involved a vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
amount of advertising, of agitation, of discussion,
and dissension. The country’s energies and attention
have been drained away from the simple
exigencies of the situation and from the technique
of countering the submarine menace and ending
the war. Five months have passed since the beginning
of unrestricted submarine warfare. We
have done nothing to overcome the submarine.
The food and ship programmes are still unconsolidated.
The absorption of Congress and the
country in the loan and the conscript army and
the censorship has meant just so much less absorption
in the vital and urgent technique to provide
which we entered the war. The country has been
put to work at a vast number of activities which
are consonant to the abstract condition of war, but
which may have little relation to the particular
situation in which this country found itself and to
the particular strategy required. The immediate
task was to prevent German victory in order to
restore the outlines of our strategy toward a negotiated
peace. War has been impotent in that immediate
task. Paradoxically, therefore, our
very participation was a means of weakening our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
strategy. We have not overcome the submarine
or freed the Atlantic world. Our entrance has
apparently made not a dent in the morale of the
German people. The effect of our entrance, it
was anticipated by liberals, would be the shortening
of the war. Our entrance has rather tended
to prolong it. Liberals were mistaken about the
immediate collapse of the British Commonwealth.
It continued to endure the submarine challenge
without our material aid. We find ourselves,
therefore, saddled with a war-technique which has
compromised rather than furthered our strategy.</p>

<p>This war-technique compromises the outlines of
American strategy because instead of making for
a negotiated peace it has had the entirely unexpected
result of encouraging those forces in the
Allied countries who desire <i>la victoire intégrale</i>,
the “knockout blow.” In the President’s war-message
the country was assured that the principles
of the negotiated peace remained quite unimpaired.
The strategy that underlay this, it will
be remembered, was to appeal to the Teutonic
peoples over the heads of their rulers with terms
so liberal that the peoples would force their governments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
to make peace. The strategy of the
American government was, while prosecuting the
war, to announce its war-aims and to persuade the
Allies to announce their war-aims in such terms
as would split the peoples of the Central Powers
from their governments, thus bringing more democratic
régimes that would provide a fruitful basis
for a covenant of nations. We entered the war
with no grievances of our own. It was our
peculiar rôle to continue the initiative for peace,
both by unmistakably showing our own purpose
for a just peace based on some kind of international
organization and by wielding a steady
pressure on the Entente governments to ratify our
programme. If we lost this initiative for peace,
or if we were unable or unwilling to press the
Entente toward an unmistakable liberalism, our
strategy broke down and our justification for entering
the war became seriously impaired. For we
could then be charged with merely aiding the Entente’s
ambiguous scheme of European reorganization.</p>

<p>The success of this strategy of peace depended
on a stern disavowal of the illiberal programmes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
of groups within the Allied countries and a sympathetic
attitude toward the most democratic programmes
of groups within the enemy Powers.
Anything which weakened either this disavowal
or this sympathy would imperil our American case.
As potential allies in this strategy the American
government had within the enemies’ gates the followers
of Scheidemann who said at the last sitting
of the Reichstag: “If the Entente Powers should
renounce all claims for annexation and indemnity
and if the Central Powers should insist on continuing
the war, a revolution will certainly result
in Germany.” It is not inconceivable that the
American government and the German socialists
had at the back of their minds the same kind of a
just peace. The fact that the German socialists
were not opposing the German government did not
mean that any peace move in which the former
were interested was necessarily a sinister Hohenzollern
intrigue. The bitterest enemies of Hollweg
were not the radicals but the Pan-Germans
themselves. It is they who were said to be circulating
manifestoes through the army threatening
revolution unless their programme of wholesale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
annexations is carried out. Whatever liberal
reservoir of power there is in Germany, therefore,
remains in the socialist ranks. If there is any
chance of liberal headway against the sinister Pan-German
campaign it is through this nucleus of
liberal power. American strategy, if it has to find
a liberal leverage in Germany, will have to choose
the socialist group as against the Pan-Germans.
It is not absolutely necessary to assume that the
support of the Chancellor by the socialist majority
is permanent. It is unplausible that the Scheidemann
group coöperates with the Government for
peace merely to consolidate the Junker and military
class in power after the war. It is quite conceivable
that the socialist majority desires peace
in order to have a safe basis for a liberal overturn.
Revolution, impossible while the Fatherland
is in danger, becomes a practicable issue as
soon as war is ended. A policy of aiding the Government
in its pressure toward peace, in order to
be in a tactical position to control the Government
when the war-peril was ended, would be an extremely
astute piece of statesmanship. There is
no evidence that the German socialists are incapable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
of such far-sighted strategy. Certainly the
“German peace” of a Scheidemann is bound to be
entirely different from the “German peace” of a
Hindenburg. This difference is one of the decisive
factors of the American strategy. To ignore
it is to run the risk of postponing and perhaps
obstructing the settlement of the war.</p>

<p>It is these considerations that make the refusal
of passports to the American socialists seem a serious
weakening of the American strategy. A conference
of responsible socialists from the different
countries might have clarified the question how far
a Russian peace or a Scheidemann peace differed
from the structure of a Wilson peace. By denying
American participation in the conference, the
Administration apparently renounced the opportunity
to make contact with liberal leverage in
Germany. It refused to take that aggressive step
in cleaving German opinion which was demanded
by its own strategy. It tended to discourage liberal
opinion in Germany and particularly it discouraged
the Russian democracy which was enthusiastic
for a socialist conference.</p>

<p>This incident was symptomatic of the lessened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
adjustment which the Administration has shown
toward the changing situation. It was the hope of
the American liberals who advocated American
entrance into the war that this country would not
lose thereby its initiative for peace. They believed
that our entrance would make our mediating
power actually stronger. That hope has been
disappointed through the unexpected radicalism of
the new Russian government. The initiative for
peace was bound to lie with the people that most
wanted peace and was willing to make the most
peremptory demands upon the Allied governments
that they state the war-aims that would bring it.
This tactic was an integral part of the original
American strategy. The American liberals
trusted the President to use American participation
as an instrument in liberalizing the war-aims
of all the Allied governments. In the event, however,
it has not been America that has wanted
peace sufficiently to be peremptory about it. It
has been Russia. The initiative for peace has
passed from President Wilson into the hands of
the Council of Workmen’s and Soldiers’ Deputies.
It is the latter who have brought the pressure to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
declare democratic war-aims. It is their dissatisfaction
with the original Allied statement that has
brought these new, if scarcely more satisfactory,
declarations. In this discussion between the Governments
regarding the restatement of war-aims,
it was not upon Russia’s side that this country
found itself. The President’s note to Russia had
all the tone of a rebuke. It sounded like the reaction
of a Government which—supposedly itself
the leader in the campaign for a just peace—found
itself uncomfortably challenged to state its own
sincerity. The key to our American strategy has
been surrendered to Russia. The plain fact is
that the President has lost that position of leader
which a Russian candor would have retained for
him.</p>

<p>What is more serious is that the note to Russia
implied not only his loss of the initiative for a
negotiated peace but even the desire for it. “The
day has come when we must conquer or submit.”
This has a very strange ring coming from a President
who in his very war-message still insisted that
he had not altered in any way the principles of his
“peace without victory” note. The note to Russia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
did not attempt to explain how “peace without
victory” was to be reconciled with “conquer or
submit,” nor has any such explanation been forthcoming.
The implication is that the entire strategy
of the negotiated peace has passed out of
American hands into those of Russia, and that this
country is committed to the new strategy of the
“knockout blow.” If this is true, then we have
the virtual collapse of the strategy, and with it
the justification, of our entrance into the war.</p>

<p>Whether American strategy has changed or not,
the effect upon opinion in the Allied countries
seems to be as if it had. Each pronouncement of
America’s war-aims is received with disconcerting
unanimity in England, France and Italy as ratifying
their own aspirations and policies. Any hint
that Allied policies disagree with ours is received
with marked disfavor by our own loyal press.
When we entered the war, the Allied aims stood
as stated in their reply to the President’s December
note. This reply was then interpreted by
American liberals as a diplomatic programme of
maximum demands. They have therefore called
repeatedly upon the President to secure from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Allied governments a resolution of the ambiguities
and a revision of the more extreme terms, in order
that we might make common cause with them toward
a just peace. In this campaign the American
liberals have put themselves squarely on the side
of the new Russia, which has also clamored for a
clear and liberal statement of what the war is being
fought for. Unfortunately the Administration
has been unable or unwilling to secure from
the Allies any such resolution or revision. The
Russian pressure has elicited certain statements,
which, however, proved little more satisfactory to
the Russian radicals than the original statement.
Our own war-aims have been stated in terms as
ambiguous and unsatisfactory as those of the Allies.
Illiberal opinion in the other countries has
not been slow in seizing upon President Wilson’s
pronouncements as confirming all that their hearts
could wish. Most significant has been the satisfaction
of Italian imperialistic opinion, the most
predatory and illiberal force in any Allied country.
The President has done nothing to disabuse Italian
minds of their belief. He has made no disavowal
of the Allied reactionary ratification. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
sharp divergence of interpretation between the Allied
governments and the Russian radicals persists.
In lieu of any clear statement to the contrary,
opinion in the Allied countries has good ground
for believing that the American government will
back up whatever of their original programme can
be carried through. Particularly is this true after
the President’s chiding of Russia. The animus
behind the enthusiasm for Pershing in France is
the conviction that American force will be the decisive
factor in the winning back of Alsace-Lorraine.
It is no mere sentimental pleasure at
American alliance. It is an immense stiffening
of the determination to hold out to the uttermost,
to the “peace with victory” of which Ribot speaks.
Deluded France carries on the war to complete exhaustion
on the strength of the American millions
who are supposedly rushing to save her. The immediate
effect of American participation in England
and Italy as well has been an intense will to
hold out not for the “peace without victory” but
<i>pour la victoire intégrale</i>, for the conquest so
crushing that Germany will never be feared again.</p>

<p>Now the crux of American strategy was the liberalization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
of Allied policy in order that that
peace might be obtained which was a hopeful basis
for a League of Nations. American participation
has evidently not gone one inch toward liberalizing
the Allies. We are further from the negotiated
peace than we were in December, though the
only change in the military and political situation
is the Russian revolution which immensely increased
the plausibility of that peace. As Allied
hope of victory grows, the covenant of nations
fades into the background. And it is Allied hope
of victory that our participation has inflamed and
augmented.</p>

<p>The President’s Flag Day address marks without
a doubt the collapse of American strategy.
That address, coupled with the hints of “effective
readjustments” in the note to Russia, implies that
America is ready to pour out endless blood and
treasure, not to the end of a negotiated peace, but
to the utter crushing of the Central Powers, to
their dismemberment and political annihilation.
The war is pictured in that address as a struggle to
the death against the military empire of Mittel-Europa.
The American rôle changes from that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
mediator in the interest of international organization
to that of formidable support to the breaking
of this menace to the peace and liberty of Europe.
It will be remembered that American liberals interpreted
our entrance into the war as primarily
defensive, an enterprise to prevent Germany’s
threatened victory on the sea. We came in, not
to secure an Allied “peace with victory,” but to
prevent a German “peace with victory,” and so
restore the situation favorable to a negotiated
peace. The strategy of the negotiated peace depended
largely on the belief that a military decision
was either impossible or was not worth the
colossal sacrifice it demanded. But it is only as
the result of a sweeping military decision that any
assured destruction of Mittel-Europa could come.
In basing his case on Mittel-Europa, therefore, the
President has clearly swung from a strategy of
“peace without victory” to a strategy of “war to
exhaustion for the sake of a military decision.”
He implies that a country which came only after
hesitation to the defense of the seas and the Atlantic
world will contentedly pour out its indefinite
blood and treasure for the sake of spoiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
the coalition of Mittel-Europa and of making readjustments
in the map of Europe effective against
German influence on the Continent. Such an implication
means the “end of American isolation”
with a vengeance. No one can be blamed who
sees in the Flag Day Address the almost unlimited
countersigning of Allied designs and territorial
schemes.</p>

<p>The change of American strategy to a will for
a military decision would explain the creation of
the vast American army which in the original policy
was required only “as a reserve and a precaution.”
It explains our close coöperation with the
Allied governments following the visits of the
Missions. An American army of millions would
undoubtedly be a decisive factor in the remaking
of the map of Europe and the permanent garrisoning
of strategic points bearing upon Germany.
But this change of strategy does not explain
itself. The continental military and political
situation has not altered in any way which justifies
so fundamental an alteration in American
strategy. American liberals justified our entrance
into the war as a response to a sudden exigency.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
But the menace of Mittel-Europa has existed ever
since the entrance of Bulgaria in 1915. If it now
challenges us and justifies our change of strategy,
it challenged us and justified our assault a full two
years ago. American shudders at its bogey are
doubly curious because it is probably less of a menace
now than it has ever been. President Wilson
ignores the effect of a democratic Russia on the
success of such a military coalition. Such heterogeneous
states could be held together only through
the pressure of a strong external fear. But the
passing of predatory Russia removes that fear.
Furthermore, Bulgaria, the most democratic of the
Balkan States, would always be an uncertain partner
in such a coalition. Bagdad has long been in
British hands. There are strong democratic and
federalistic forces at work in the Austro-Hungarian
monarchy. The materials seem less ready
than ever for the creation of any such predatory
and subjugated Empire as the Flag Day Address
describes. Whatever the outcome of the war,
there is likely to result an economic union which
could bring needed civilization to neglected and
primitive lands. But such a union would be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
blessing to Europe rather than a curse. It was
such a union that England was on the point of
granting to Germany when the war broke out.
The Balkans and Asia Minor need German science,
German organization, German industrial development.
We can hardly be fighting to prevent
such German influence in these lands. The
irony of the President’s words lies in the fact that
the hopes of Mittel-Europa as a military coalition
seem to grow dimmer rather than brighter. He
must know that this “enslavement” of the peoples
of which he speaks can only be destroyed by the
peoples themselves and not at the imposition of a
military conqueror. The will to resist this Prussian
enslavement seems to have been generated in
Austro-Hungary. The President’s perspective is
belated. If our fighting to crush this amazing
plot is justified now, it was more than justified as
soon as Rumania was defeated. The President
convicts himself of criminal negligence in not urging
us into the war at that time. If our rôle
was to aid in conquest, we could not have begun
our work too soon.</p>

<p>The new strategy is announced by the President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
in no uncertain terms—“The day has come when
we must conquer or submit.” But the strategy of
conquest implies the necessity of means for consolidating
the conquest. If the world is to be
made safe for democracy, democracy must to a
certain extent be imposed on the world. There is
little point in conquering unless you carry through
the purposes for which you have conquered. The
earlier American strategy sought to bring democracy
to Germany by appealing directly to the democratic
forces in Germany itself. We relied on a
self-motivated regeneration on the part of our enemy.
We believed that democracy could be imposed
only from within. If the German people
cannot effect their own political reorganization,
nobody can do it for them. They would continue
to prefer the native Hohenzollerns to the most
liberal government imposed by their conquering
enemies. A Germany forced to be democratic under
the tutelage of a watchful and victorious Entente
would indeed be a constant menace to the
peace of Europe. Just so far then as our changed
American strategy contributes toward a conquest
over Germany, it will work against our desire to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
see that country spontaneously democratized.
There is reason for hope that democracy will not
have to be forced on Germany. From the present
submission of the German people to the war-régime
nothing can be deduced as to their subserviency
after the war. Prodigious slaughter will
effect profound social changes. There may be going
on a progressive selection in favor of democratic
elements. The Russian army was transformed
into a democratic instrument by the wiping-out
in battle of the upper-class officers. Men
of democratic and revolutionary sympathies took
their places. A similar process may happen in
the German army. The end of the war may
leave the German “army of the people” a genuine
popular army intent upon securing control
of the civil government. Furthermore, the continuance
of Pan-German predatory imperialism
depends on a younger generation of Junkers to replace
the veterans now in control. The most daring
of those aristocrats will almost certainly have
been destroyed in battle. The mortality in upper-class
leadership will certainly have proved far
larger than the mortality in lower-class leadership.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
The maturing of these tendencies is the hope of
German democracy. A speedy ending of the war,
before the country is exhausted and the popular
morale destroyed, is likely best to mature these
tendencies. In this light it is almost immaterial
what terms are made. Winning or losing, Germany
cannot replace her younger generation of
the ruling class. And without a ruling class to
continue the imperial tradition, democracy could
scarcely be delayed. An enfeebled ruling class
could neither hold a vast world military Empire
together nor resist the revolutionary elements at
home. The prolongation of the war delays democracy
in Germany by convincing the German
people that they are fighting for their very existence
and thereby forcing them to cling even more
desperately to their military leaders. In announcing
an American strategy of “conquer or
submit,” the President virtually urges the German
people to prolong the war. And not only are the
German people, at the apparent price of their existence,
tacitly urged to continue the fight to the
uttermost, but the Allied governments are tacitly
urged to wield the “knockout blow.” All those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
reactionary elements in England, France and
Italy, whose spirits drooped at the President’s original
bid for a negotiated peace, now take heart
again at this apparent countersigning of their most
extreme programmes.</p>

<p>American liberals who urged the nation to war
are therefore suffering the humiliation of seeing
their liberal strategy for peace transformed into a
strategy for prolonged war. This government
was to announce such war-aims as should persuade
the peoples of the Central Powers to make an irresistible
demand for a democratic peace. Our initiative
with the Allied governments was to make
this peace the basis of an international covenant,
“the creation of a community of limited independencies,”
of which Norman Angell speaks. Those
Americans who opposed our entrance into the war
believed that this object could best be worked for
by a strategy of continued neutrality and the constant
pressure of mediation. They believed that
war would defeat the strategy for a liberal peace.
The liberal intellectuals who supported the President
felt that only by active participation on an
independent basis could their purposes be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
achieved. The event has signally betrayed them.
We have not ended the submarine menace. We
have lost all power for mediation. We have not
even retained the democratic leadership among the
Allied nations. We have surrendered the initiative
for peace. We have involved ourselves in a
moral obligation to send large armies to Europe
to secure a military decision for the Allies. We
have prolonged the war. We have encouraged
the reactionary elements in every Allied country
to hold out for extreme demands. We have discouraged
the German democratic forces. Our
strategy has gradually become indistinguishable
from that of the Allies. With the arrival of the
British Mission our “independent basis” became a
polite fiction. The President’s Flag Day Address
merely registers the collapse of American strategy.
All this the realistic pacifists foresaw when they
held out so bitterly and unaccountably against our
entering the war. The liberals felt a naïve faith
in the sagacity of the President to make their strategy
prevail. They looked to him single-handedly
to liberalize the liberal nations. They trusted
him to use a war-technique which should consist of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
an olive-branch in one hand and a sword in the
other. They have had to see their strategy collapse
under the very weight of that war-technique.
Guarding neutrality, we might have counted toward
a speedy and democratic peace. In the war,
we are a rudderless nation, to be exploited as the
Allies wish, politically and materially, and towed,
to their aggrandizement, in any direction which
they may desire.</p>

A WAR DIARY</h2>

<p class="ph1">(September, 1917)</p>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span> brings a better adjustment to the war.
There had been so many times when, to those
who had energetically resisted its coming, it
seemed the last intolerable outrage. In one’s
wilder moments one expected revolt against the
impressment of unwilling men and the suppression
of unorthodox opinion. One conceived the war
as breaking down through a kind of intellectual
sabotage diffused through the country. But as
one talks to people outside the cities and away
from ruling currents of opinion, one finds the prevailing
apathy shot everywhere with acquiescence.
The war is a bad business, which somehow got
fastened on us. They don’t want to go, but
they’ve got to go. One decides that nothing generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
obstructive is going to happen and that it
would make little difference if it did. The kind
of war which we are conducting is an enterprise
which the American government does not have to
carry on with the hearty coöperation of the American
people but only with their acquiescence. And
that acquiescence seems sufficient to float an indefinitely
protracted war for vague or even largely
uncomprehended and unaccepted purposes. Our
resources in men and materials are vast enough to
organize the war-technique without enlisting more
than a fraction of the people’s conscious energy.
Many men will not like being sucked into the actual
fighting organism, but as the war goes on they
will be sucked in as individuals and they will
yield. There is likely to be no element in the
country with the effective will to help them resist.
They are not likely to resist of themselves concertedly.
They will be licked grudgingly into
military shape, and their lack of enthusiasm will
in no way unfit them for use in the hecatombs necessary
for the military decision upon which Allied
political wisdom still apparently insists. It is unlikely
that enough men will be taken from the potentially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
revolting classes seriously to embitter
their spirit. Losses in the well-to-do classes will
be sustained by a sense of duty and of reputable
sacrifice. From the point of view of the worker,
it will make little difference whether his work contributes
to annihilation overseas or to construction
at home. Temporarily, his condition is better if
it contributes to the former. We of the middle-classes
will be progressively poorer than we should
otherwise have been. Our lives will be slowly
drained by clumsily levied taxes and the robberies
of imperfectly controlled private enterprises.
But this will not cause us to revolt. There are
not likely to be enough hungry stomachs to make a
revolution. The materials seem generally absent
from the country, and as long as a government
wants to use the war-technique in its realization
of great ideas, it can count serenely on the human
resources of the country, regardless of popular
mandate or understanding.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>If human resources are fairly malleable into the
war-technique, our material resources will prove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
to be even more so, quite regardless of the individual
patriotism of their owners or workers. It
is almost purely a problem of diversion. Factories
and mines and farms will continue to turn
out the same products and at an intensified rate,
but the government will be working to use their
activity and concentrate it as contributory to the
war. The process which the piping times of benevolent
neutrality began will be pursued to its
extreme end. All this will be successful, however,
precisely as it is made a matter of centralized
governmental organization and not of individual
offerings of good-will and enterprise. It will be
coercion from above that will do the trick rather
than patriotism from below. Democratic contentment
may be shed over the land for a time
through the appeal to individual thoughtfulness in
saving and in relinquishing profits. But all that
is really needed is the coöperation with government
of the men who direct the large financial
and industrial enterprises. If their interest is enlisted
in diverting the mechanism of production
into war-channels, it makes not the least difference
whether you or I want our activity to count in aid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
of the war. Whatever we do will contribute toward
its successful organization, and toward the
riveting of a semi-military State-socialism on the
country. As long as the effective managers, the
“big men” in the staple industries remained loyal,
nobody need care what the millions of little human
cogs who had to earn their living felt or
thought. This is why the technical organization
for this American war goes on so much more rapidly
than any corresponding popular sentiment for
its aims and purposes. Our war is teaching us
that patriotism is really a superfluous quality in
war. The government of a modern organized
plutocracy does not have to ask whether the people
want to fight or understand what they are fighting
for, but only whether they will tolerate fighting.
America does not coöperate with the President’s
designs. She rather feebly acquiesces. But that
feeble acquiescence is the all-important factor.
We are learning that war doesn’t need enthusiasm,
doesn’t need conviction, doesn’t need hope, to sustain
it. Once maneuvered, it takes care of itself,
provided only that our industrial rulers see that
the end of the war will leave American capital in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
a strategic position for world-enterprise. The
American people might be much more indifferent
to the war even than they are and yet the results
would not be materially different. A majority of
them might even be feebly or at least unconcertedly
hostile to the war, and yet it would go gaily
on. That is why a popular referendum seems so
supremely irrelevant to people who are willing to
use war as an instrument in the working-out of
national policy. And that is why this war, with
apathy rampant, is probably going to act just as if
every person in the country were filled with patriotic
ardor, and furnished with a completely assimilated
map of the League to Enforce Peace.
If it doesn’t, the cause will not be the lack of popular
ardor, but the clumsiness of the government
officials in organizing the technique of the war.
Our country in war, given efficiency at the top, can
do very well without our patriotism. The non-patriotic
man need feel no pangs of conscience
about not helping the war. Patriotism fades into
the merest trivial sentimentality when it becomes,
as so obviously in a situation like this, so pragmatically
impotent. As long as one has to earn one’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
living or buy tax-ridden goods, one is making one’s
contribution to war in a thousand indirect ways.
The war, since it does not need it, cannot fairly
demand also the sacrifice of one’s spiritual integrity.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The “liberals” who claim a realistic and pragmatic
attitude in politics have disappointed us in
setting up and then clinging wistfully to the belief
that our war could get itself justified for an idealistic
flavor, or at least for a world-renovating
social purpose, that they had more or less denied
to the other belligerents. If these realists had had
time in the hurry and scuffle of events to turn their
philosophy on themselves, they might have seen
how thinly disguised a rationalization this was of
their emotional undertow. They wanted a
League of Nations. They had an unanalyzable
feeling that this was a war in which we had to be,
and be in it we would. What more natural than
to join the two ideas and conceive our war as the
decisive factor in the attainment of the desired
end! This gave them a good conscience for willing
American participation, although as good men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
they must have loathed war and everything connected
with it. The realist cannot deny facts.
Moreover, he must not only acknowledge them but
he must use them. Good or bad, they must be
turned by his intelligence to some constructive
end. Working along with the materials which
events give him, he must get where and what he
can, and bring something brighter and better out
of the chaos.</p>

<p>Now war is such an indefeasible and unescapable
Real that the good realist must accept it
rather comprehensively. To keep out of it is pure
quietism, an acute moral failure to adjust. At the
same time, there is an inexorability about war.
It is a little unbridled for the realist’s rather nice
sense of purposive social control. And nothing is
so disagreeable to the pragmatic mind as any kind
of an absolute. The realistic pragmatist could
not recognize war as inexorable—though to the
common mind it would seem as near an absolute,
coercive social situation as it is possible to fall into.
For the inexorable abolishes choices, and it is the
essence of the realist’s creed to have, in every situation,
alternatives before him. He gets out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
his scrape in this way: Let the inexorable roll in
upon me, since it must. But then, keeping firm
my sense of control, I will somehow tame it and
turn it to my own creative purposes. Thus realism
is justified of her children, and the “liberal”
is saved from the limbo of the wailing and irreconcilable
pacifists who could not make so easy an
adjustment.</p>

<p>Thus the “liberals” who made our war their
own preserved their pragmatism. But events
have shown how fearfully they imperilled their
intuition and how untameable an inexorable really
is. For those of us who knew a real inexorable
when we saw one, and had learned from watching
war what follows the loosing of a war-technique,
foresaw how quickly aims and purposes would be
forgotten, and how flimsy would be any liberal
control of events. It is only we now who can appreciate
<i>The New Republic</i>—the organ of applied
pragmatic realism—when it complains that
the League of Peace (which we entered the war
to guarantee) is more remote than it was eight
months ago; or that our State Department has no
diplomatic policy (though it was to realize the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
high aims of the President’s speeches that the intellectuals
willed American participation); or that
we are subordinating the political management of
the war to real or supposed military advantages,
(though militarism in the liberal mind had no justification
except as a tool for advanced social
ends). If after all the idealism and creative intelligence
that were shed upon America’s taking up
of arms, our State Department has no policy, we
are like brave passengers who have set out for the
Isles of the Blest only to find that the first mate
has gone insane and jumped overboard, the rudder
has come loose and dropped to the bottom of the
sea, and the captain and pilot are lying dead drunk
under the wheel. The stokers and engineers,
however, are still merrily forcing the speed up to
twenty knots an hour and the passengers are presumably
getting the pleasure of the ride.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The penalty the realist pays for accepting war
is to see disappear one by one the justifications for
accepting it. He must either become a genuine
Realpolitiker and brazen it through, or else he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
must feel sorry for his intuition and regretful that
he willed the war. But so easy is forgetting and
so slow the change of events that he is more likely
to ignore the collapse of his case. If he finds that
his government is relinquishing the crucial moves
of that strategy for which he was willing to use the
technique of war, he is likely to move easily to the
ground that it will all come out in the end the same
anyway. He soon becomes satisfied with tacitly
ratifying whatever happens, or at least straining
to find the grain of unplausible hope that may
be latent in the situation.</p>

<p>But what then is there really to choose between
the realist who accepts evil in order to manipulate
it to a great end, but who somehow unaccountably
finds events turn sour on him, and the Utopian
pacifist who cannot stomach the evil and will
have none of it? Both are helpless, both are
coerced. The Utopian, however, knows that he is
ineffective and that he is coerced, while the realist,
evading disillusionment, moves in a twilight zone
of half-hearted criticism, and hopings for the best,
where he does not become a tacit fatalist. The
latter would be the manlier position, but then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
where would be his realistic philosophy of intelligence
and choice? Professor Dewey has become
impatient at the merely good and merely conscientious
objectors to war who do not attach their
conscience and intelligence to forces moving in another
direction. But in wartime there are literally
no valid forces moving in another direction.
War determines its own end—victory, and government
crushes out automatically all forces that deflect,
or threaten to deflect, energy from the path
of organization to that end. All governments
will act in this way, the most democratic as well
as the most autocratic. It is only “liberal”
naïveté that is shocked at arbitrary coercion and
suppression. Willing war means willing all the
evils that are organically bound up with it. A
good many people still seem to believe in a peculiar
kind of democratic and antiseptic war.
The pacifists opposed the war because they knew
this was an illusion, and because of the myriad
hurts they knew war would do the promise of democracy
at home. For once the babes and sucklings
seem to have been wiser than the children of
light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>If it is true that the war will go on anyway
whether it is popular or not or whether its purposes
are clear, and if it is true that in wartime constructive
realism is an illusion, then the aloof man,
the man who will not obstruct the war but who
cannot spiritually accept it, has a clear case for
himself. Our war presents no more extraordinary
phenomenon than the number of the more creative
minds of the younger generation who are still irreconcilable
toward the great national enterprise
which the government has undertaken. The
country is still dotted with young men and women,
in full possession of their minds, faculties and virtue,
who feel themselves profoundly alien to the
work which is going on around them. They must
not be confused with the disloyal or the pro-German.
They have no grudge against the country,
but their patriotism has broken down in the emergency.
They want to see the carnage stopped and
Europe decently constructed again. They want a
democratic peace. If the swift crushing of Germany
will bring that peace, they want to see Germany
crushed. If the embargo on neutrals will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
prove the decisive coup, they are willing to see the
neutrals taken ruthlessly by the throat. But they
do not really believe that peace will come by any
of these means, or by any use of our war-technique
whatever. They are genuine pragmatists and
they fear any kind of an absolute, even when bearing
gifts. They know that the longer a war lasts
the harder it is to make peace. They know that
the peace of exhaustion is a dastardly peace, leaving
enfeebled the morale of the defeated, and leaving
invincible for years all the most greedy and
soulless elements in the conquerors. They feel
that the greatest obstacle to peace now is the lack
of the powerful mediating neutral which we might
have been. They see that war has lost for us both
the mediation and the leadership, and is blackening
us ever deeper with the responsibility for having
prolonged the dreadful tangle. They are
skeptical not only of the technique of war, but also
of its professed aims. The President’s idealism
stops just short of the pitch that would arouse their
own. There is a middle-aged and belated taint
about the best ideals which publicist liberalism has
been able to express. The appeals to propagate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
political democracy leave these people cold in a
world which has become so disillusioned of democracy
in the face of universal economic servitude.
Their ideals outshoot the government’s. To them
the real arena lies in the international class-struggle,
rather than in the competition of artificial national
units. They are watching to see what the
Russian socialists are going to do for the world,
not what the timorous capitalistic American democracy
may be planning. They can feel no enthusiasm
for a League of Nations, which should
solidify the old units and continue in disguise the
old theories of international relations. Indispensable,
perhaps? But not inspiring; not something
to give one’s spiritual allegiance to. And yet the
best advice that American wisdom can offer to
those who are out of sympathy with the war is to
turn one’s influence toward securing that our war
contribute toward this end. But why would not
this League turn out to be little more than a well-oiled
machine for the use of that enlightened imperialism
toward which liberal American finance
is already whetting its tongue? And what is enlightened
imperialism as an international ideal as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
against the anarchistic communism of the nations
which the new Russia suggests in renouncing imperialist
intentions?</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Skeptical of the means and skeptical of the
aims, this element of the younger generation stands
outside the war, and looks upon the conscript army
and all the other war-activities as troublesome interruptions
on its thought and idealism, interruptions
which do not touch anywhere a fiber of its
soul. Some have been much more disturbed than
others, because of the determined challenge of both
patriots and realists to break in with the war-obsession
which has filled for them their sky. Patriots
and realists can both be answered. They
must not be allowed to shake one’s inflexible determination
not to be spiritually implicated in the
war. It is foolish to hope. Since the 30th of
July, 1914, nothing has happened in the arena of
war-policy and war-technique except for the complete
and unmitigated worst. We are tired of
continued disillusionment, and of the betrayal of
generous anticipations. It is saner not to waste<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
energy in hope within the system of war-enterprise.
One may accept dispassionately whatever changes
for good may happen from the war, but one will
not allow one’s imagination to connect them organically
with war. It is better to resist cheap
consolations, and remain skeptical about any of
the good things so confidently promised us either
through victory or the social reorganization demanded
by the war-technique. One keeps healthy
in wartime not by a series of religious and political
consolations that something good is coming out of
it all, but by a vigorous assertion of values in
which war has no part. Our skepticism can be
made a shelter behind which is built up a wider
consciousness of the personal and social and artistic
ideals which American civilization needs to
lead the good life. We can be skeptical constructively,
if, thrown back on our inner resources from
the world of war which is taken as the overmastering
reality, we search much more actively to clarify
our attitudes and express a richer significance
in the American scene. We do not feel the war
to be very real, and we sense a singular air of
falsity about the emotions of the upper-classes toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
everything connected with war. This ostentatious
shame, this groveling before illusory
Allied heroisms and nobilities, has shocked us.
Minor novelists and minor poets and minor publicists
are still coming back from driving ambulances
in France to write books that nag us into an
appreciation of the “real meaning.” No one can
object to the generous emotions of service in a
great cause or to the horror and pity at colossal
devastation and agony. But too many of these
prophets are men who have lived rather briskly
among the cruelties and thinnesses of American
civilization and have shown no obvious horror and
pity at the exploitations and the arid quality of the
life lived here around us. Their moral sense had
been deeply stirred by what they saw in France
and Belgium, but it was a moral sense relatively
unpracticed by deep concern and reflection over
the inadequacies of American democracy. Few of
them had used their vision to create literature impelling
us toward a more radiant American future.
And that is why, in spite of their vivid stirrings,
they seem so unconvincing. Their idealism is too
new and bright to affect us, for it comes from men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
who never cared very particularly about great
creative American ideas. So these writers come
to us less like ardent youth, pouring its energy into
the great causes, than like youthful mouthpieces of
their strident and belligerent elders. They did
not convert us, but rather drove us farther back
into the rightness of American isolation.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>There was something incredibly mean and plebeian
about that abasement into which the war-partisans
tried to throw us all. When we were
urged to squander our emotion on a bedeviled
Europe, our intuition told us how much all rich
and generous emotions were needed at home to
leaven American civilization. If we refused to
export them it was because we wanted to see them
at work here. It is true that great reaches of
American prosperous life were not using generous
emotions for any purpose whatever. But the real
antithesis was not between being concerned about
luxurious automobiles and being concerned about
the saving of France. America’s “benevolent
neutrality” had been saving the Allies for three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
years through the ordinary channels of industry
and trade. We could afford to export material
goods and credit far more than we could afford to
export emotional capital. The real antithesis was
between interest in expensively exploiting American
material life and interest in creatively enhancing
American personal and artistic life. The fat
and earthy American could be blamed not for not
palpitating more richly about France, but for not
palpitating more richly about America and her
spiritual drouths. The war will leave the country
spiritually impoverished, because of the draining
away of sentiment into the channels of war.
Creative and constructive enterprises will suffer
not only through the appalling waste of financial
capital in the work of annihilation, but also in the
loss of emotional capital in the conviction that war
overshadows all other realities. This is the poison
of war that disturbs even creative minds. Writers
tell us that, after contact with the war, literature
seems an idle pastime, if not an offense, in a
world of great deeds. Perhaps literature that can
be paled by war will not be missed. We may feel
vastly relieved at our salvation from so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
feeble novels and graceful verses that khaki-clad
authors might have given us. But this nobly-sounding
sense of the futility of art in a world
of war may easily infect conscientious minds.
And it is against this infection that we must fight.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The conservation of American promise is the
present task for this generation of malcontents and
aloof men and women. If America has lost its
political isolation, it is all the more obligated to retain
its spiritual integrity. This does not mean
any smug retreat from the world, with a belief
that the truth is in us and can only be contaminated
by contact. It means that the promise of
American life is not yet achieved, perhaps not even
seen, and that, until it is, there is nothing for us
but stern and intensive cultivation of our garden.
Our insulation will not be against any great creative
ideas or forms that Europe brings. It will be
a turning within in order that we may have something
to give without. The old American ideas
which are still expected to bring life to the world
seem stale and archaic. It is grotesque to try to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
carry democracy to Russia. It is absurd to try to
contribute to the world’s store of great moving
ideas until we have a culture to give. It is absurd
for us to think of ourselves as blessing the
world with anything unless we hold it much more
self-consciously and significantly than we hold
anything now. Mere negative freedom will not
do as a twentieth-century principle. American
ideas must be dynamic or we are presumptuous in
offering them to the world.</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>The war—or American promise: one must
choose. One cannot be interested in both. For
the effect of the war will be to impoverish American
promise. It cannot advance it, however liberals
may choose to identify American promise
with a league of nations to enforce peace. Americans
who desire to cultivate the promises of American
life need not lift a finger to obstruct the war,
but they cannot conscientiously accept it. However
intimately a part of their country they may
feel in its creative enterprises toward a better life,
they cannot feel themselves a part of it in its futile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
and self-mutilating enterprise of war. We
can be apathetic with a good conscience, for we
have other values and ideals for America. Our
country will not suffer for our lack of patriotism
as long as it has that of our industrial masters.
Meanwhile, those who have turned their thinking
into war-channels have abdicated their leadership
for this younger generation. They have put
themselves in a limbo of interests that are not the
concerns which worry us about American life and
make us feverish and discontented.</p>

<p>Let us compel the war to break in on us, if it
must, not go hospitably to meet it. Let us force
it perceptibly to batter in our spiritual walls.
This attitude need not be a fatuous hiding in the
sand, denying realities. When we are broken in
on, we can yield to the inexorable. Those who
are conscripted will have been broken in on. If
they do not want to be martyrs, they will have to
be victims. They are entitled to whatever alleviations
are possible in an inexorable world. But
the others can certainly resist the attitude that
blackens the whole conscious sky with war. They
can resist the poison which makes art and all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
desires for more impassioned living seem idle and
even shameful. For many of us, resentment
against the war has meant a vivider consciousness
of what we are seeking in American life.</p>

<p>This search has been threatened by two classes
who have wanted to deflect idealism to the war,—the
patriots and the realists. The patriots have
challenged us by identifying apathy with disloyalty.
The reply is that war-technique in this situation
is a matter of national mechanics rather
than national ardor. The realists have challenged
us by insisting that the war is an instrument in the
working-out of beneficent national policy. Our
skepticism points out to them how soon their “mastery”
becomes “drift,” tangled in the fatal drive
toward victory as its own end, how soon they become
mere agents and expositors of forces as they
are. Patriots and realists disposed of, we can pursue
creative skepticism with honesty, and at least a
hope that in the recoil from war we may find the
treasures we are looking for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Where</span> are the seeds of American promise?
Man cannot live by politics alone, and it is small
cheer that our best intellects are caught in the political
current and see only the hope that America
will find her soul in the remaking of the world.
If William James were alive would he be accepting
the war-situation so easily and complacently?
Would he be chiding the over-stimulated intelligence
of peace-loving idealists, and excommunicating
from the ranks of liberal progress the pitiful
remnant of those who struggle “above the battle”?
I like to think that his gallant spirit would
have called for a war to be gallantly played, with
insistent care for democratic values at home, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
unequivocal alliance with democratic elements
abroad for a peace that should promise more than
a mere union of benevolent imperialisms. I think
of James now because the recent articles of John
Dewey’s on the war suggest a slackening in his
thought for our guidance and stir, and the inadequacy
of his pragmatism as a philosophy of life in
this emergency. Whether James would have
given us just that note of spiritual adventure
which would make the national enterprise seem
creative for an American future,—this we can
never know. But surely that philosophy of
Dewey’s which we had been following so uncritically
for so long, breaks down almost noisily
when it is used to grind out interpretation for the
present crisis. These articles on “Conscience and
Compulsion,” “The Future of Pacifism,” “What
America Will Fight For,” “Conscription of
Thought,” which <i>The New Republic</i> has been
printing, seem to me to be a little off-color. A
philosopher who senses so little the sinister forces
of war, who is so much more concerned over the
excesses of the pacifists than over the excesses of
military policy, who can feel only amusement at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
the idea that any one should try to conscript
thought, who assumes that the war-technique can
be used without trailing along with it the mob-fanaticisms,
the injustices and hatreds, that are organically
bound up with it, is speaking to another
element of the younger intelligentsia than that to
which I belong. Evidently the attitudes which
war calls out are fiercer and more incalculable than
Professor Dewey is accustomed to take into his
hopeful and intelligent imagination, and the pragmatist
mind, in trying to adjust itself to them,
gives the air of grappling, like the pioneer who
challenges the arid plains, with a power too big
for it. It is not an arena of creative intelligence
our country’s mind is now, but of mob-psychology.
The soldiers who tried to lynch Max Eastman
showed that current patriotism is not a product of
the will to remake the world. The luxuriant releases
of explosive hatred for which peace apparently
gives far too little scope cannot be wooed
by sweet reasonableness, nor can they be the raw
material for the creation of rare liberal political
structures. All that can be done is to try to keep
your country out of situations where such expressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
releases occur. If you have willed the situation,
however, or accepted it as inevitable, it is
fatuous to protest against the gay debauch of hatred
and fear and swagger that must mount and
mount, until the heady and virulent poison of
war shall have created its own anti-toxin of ruin
and disillusionment. To talk as if war were anything
else than such a poison is to show that your
philosophy has never been confronted with the
pathless and the inexorable, and that, only dimly
feeling the change, it goes ahead acting as if it
had not got out of its depth. Only a lack of
practice with a world of human nature so raw-nerved,
irrational, uncreative, as an America at
war was bound to show itself to be, can account
for the singular unsatisfactoriness of these later utterances
of Dewey. He did have one moment of
hesitation just before the war began, when the war
and its external purposes and unifying power
seemed the small thing beside that internal adventure
which should find our American promise.
But that perspective has now disappeared, and one
finds Dewey now untainted by skepticism as to our
being about a business to which all our idealism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
should rally. That failure to get guaranties that
this country’s effort would obligate the Allies to a
democratic world-order Dewey blames on the defection
of the pacifists, and then somehow manages
to get himself into a “we” who “romantically,”
as he says, forewent this crucial link of our
strategy. Does this easy identification of himself
with undemocratically controlled foreign policy
mean that a country is democratic when it accepts
what its government does, or that war has a narcotic
effect on the pragmatic mind? For Dewey
somehow retains his sense of being in the controlling
class, and ignores those anxious questions of
democrats who have been his disciples but are now
resenters of the war.</p>

<p>What I come to is a sense of suddenly being left
in the lurch, of suddenly finding that a philosophy
upon which I had relied to carry us through no
longer works. I find the contrast between the
idea that creative intelligence has free functioning
in wartime, and the facts of the inexorable situation,
too glaring. The contrast between what liberals
ought to be doing and saying if democratic
values are to be conserved, and what the real forces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
are imposing upon them, strikes too sternly on my
intellectual senses. I should prefer some philosophy
of War as the grim and terrible cleanser to
this optimism-haunted mood that continues unweariedly
to suggest that all can yet be made to
work for good in a mad and half-destroyed world.
I wonder if James, in the face of such disaster,
would not have abandoned his “moral equivalent
of war” for an “immoral equivalent” which, in
swift and periodic saturnalia, would have acted as
vaccination against the sure pestilence of war.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Dewey’s philosophy is inspiring enough for a
society at peace, prosperous and with a fund of
progressive good-will. It is a philosophy of hope,
of clear-sighted comprehension of materials and
means. Where institutions are at all malleable,
it is the only clew for improvement. It is scientific
method applied to “uplift.” But this careful
adaptation of means to desired ends, this experimental
working-out of control over brute
forces and dead matter in the interests of communal
life, depends on a store of rationality, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
effective only where there is strong desire for
progress. It is precisely the school, the institution
to which Dewey’s philosophy was first applied,
that is of all our institutions the most malleable.
And it is the will to educate that has
seemed, in these days, among all our social attitudes
the most rationally motivated. It was education,
and almost education alone, that seemed
susceptible to the steady pressure of an “instrumental”
philosophy. Intelligence really seemed
about to come into conscious control of an institution,
and that one the most potent in molding the
attitudes needed for a civilized society and the aptitudes
needed for the happiness of the individual.</p>

<p>For both our revolutionary conceptions of what
education means, and for the intellectual strategy
of its approach, this country is immeasurably indebted
to the influence of Professor Dewey’s philosophy.
With these ideas sincerely felt, a rational
nation would have chosen education as its
national enterprise. Into this it would have
thrown its energy though the heavens fell and the
earth rocked around it. But the nation did not
use its isolation from the conflict to educate itself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
It fretted for three years and then let war, not education,
be chosen, at the almost unanimous behest
of our intellectual class, from motives alien to
our cultural needs, and for political ends alien to
the happiness of the individual. But nations, of
course, are not rational entities, and they act
within their most irrational rights when they accept
war as the most important thing the nation
can do in the face of metaphysical menaces of imperial
prestige. What concerns us here is the relative
ease with which the pragmatist intellectuals,
with Professor Dewey at the head, have moved out
their philosophy, bag and baggage, from education
to war. So abrupt a change in the direction of
the national enterprise, one would have expected
to cause more emotion, to demand more apologetics.
His optimism may have told Professor
Dewey that war would not materially demoralize
our growth—would, perhaps, after all, be but an
incident in the nation’s life—but it is not easy to
see how, as we skate toward the bankruptcy of
war-billions, there will be resources available for
educational enterprise that does not contribute directly
to the war-technique. Neither is any passion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
for growth, for creative mastery, going to
flourish among the host of militaristic values and
new tastes for power that are springing up like
poisonous mushrooms on every hand.</p>

<p>How could the pragmatist mind accept war
without more violent protest, without a greater
wrench? Either Professor Dewey and his friends
felt that the forces were too strong for them, that
the war had to be, and it was better to take it up
intelligently than to drift blindly in; or else they
really expected a gallant war, conducted with
jealous regard for democratic values at home and
a captivating vision of international democracy
as the end of all the toil and pain. If their motive
was the first, they would seem to have reduced
the scope of possible control of events to the vanishing
point. If the war is too strong for you to
prevent, how is it going to be weak enough for you
to control and mold to your liberal purposes?
And if their motive was to shape the war firmly
for good, they seem to have seriously miscalculated
the fierce urgencies of it. Are they to be content,
as the materialization of their hopes, with a doubtful
League of Nations and the suppression of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
I. W. W.? Yet the numbing power of the war-situation
seems to have kept them from realizing
what has happened to their philosophy. The betrayal
of their first hopes has certainly not discouraged
them. But neither has it roused them to
a more energetic expression of the forces through
which they intend to realize them. I search Professor
Dewey’s articles in vain for clews as to the
specific working-out of our democratic desires,
either nationally or internationally, either in the
present or in the reconstruction after the war. No
programme is suggested, nor is there feeling for
present vague popular movements and revolts.
Rather are the latter chided, for their own vagueness
and impracticalities. Similarly, with the
other prophets of instrumentalism who accompany
Dewey into the war, democracy remains an unanalyzed
term, useful as a call to battle, but not an
intellectual tool, turning up fresh sod for the
changing future. Is it the political democracy of
a plutocratic America that we are fighting for, or
is it the social democracy of the new Russia?
Which do our rulers really fear more, the menace
of Imperial Germany, or the liberating influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
of a socialist Russia. In the application of their
philosophy to politics, our pragmatists are sliding
over this crucial question of ends. Dewey
says our ends must be intelligently international
rather than chauvinistic. But this gets us little
distance along our way.</p>

<p>In this difficult time the light that has been in
liberals and radicals has become darkness. If
radicals spend their time holding conventions to
attest their loyalty and stamp out the “enemies
within,” they do not spend it in breaking intellectual
paths, or giving us shining ideas to which we
can attach our faith and conscience. The spiritual
apathy from which the more naïve of us suffer,
and which the others are so busy fighting,
arises largely from sheer default of a clear vision
that would melt it away. Let the motley crew
of ex-socialists, and labor radicals, and liberals
and pragmatist philosophers, who have united for
the prosecution of the war, present a coherent and
convincing democratic programme, and they will
no longer be confronted with the skepticism of the
conscientious and the impossibilist. But when
the emphasis is on technical organization, rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
than organization of ideas, on strategy rather than
desires, one begins to suspect that no programme
is presented because they have none to present.
This burrowing into war-technique hides the void
where a democratic philosophy should be. Our
intellectuals consort with war-boards in order to
keep their minds off the question what the slow
masses of the people are really desiring, or toward
what the best hope of the country really drives.
Similarly the blaze of patriotism on the part of
the radicals serves the purpose of concealing the
feebleness of their intellectual light.</p>

<p>Is the answer that clear formulation of democratic
ends must be postponed until victory in the
war is attained? But to make this answer is to
surrender the entire case. For the support of the
war by radicals, realists, pragmatists, is due—or
so they say—to the fact that the war is not only
saving the cause of democracy, but is immensely
accelerating its progress. Well, what are those
gains? How are they to be conserved? What
do they lead to? How can we further them?
Into what large idea of society do they group?
To ignore these questions, and think only of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
war-technique and its accompanying devotions, is
to undermine the foundations of these people’s
own faith.</p>

<p>A policy of “win the war first” must be, for the
radical, a policy of intellectual suicide. Their
support of the war throws upon them the responsibility
of showing inch by inch the democratic
gains, and of laying out a charter of specific hopes.
Otherwise they confess that they are impotent and
that the war is submerging their expectations, or
that they are not genuinely imaginative and offer
little promise for future leadership.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>It may seem unfair to group Professor Dewey
with Mr. Spargo and Mr. Gompers, Mr. A. M.
Simons, and the Vigilantes. I do so only because
in their acceptance of the war, they are all living
out that popular American “instrumental” philosophy
which Professor Dewey has formulated in
such convincing and fascinating terms. On an infinitely
more intelligent plane, he is yet one with
them in his confidence that the war is motivated
by democratic ends and is being made to serve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
them. A high mood of confidence and self-righteousness
moves them all, a keen sense of control
over events that makes them eligible to discipleship
under Professor Dewey’s philosophy. They
are all hostile to impossibilism, to apathy, to any
attitude that is not a cheerful and brisk setting
to work to use the emergency to consolidate the
gains of democracy. Not, Is it being used? but,
Let us make a flutter about using it! This unanimity
of mood puts the resenter of war out of
the arena. But he can still seek to explain why
this philosophy which has no place for the inexorable
should have adjusted itself so easily to the
inexorable of war, and why, although a philosophy
of the creative intelligence in using means
toward ends, it should show itself so singularly
impoverished in its present supply of democratic
values.</p>

<p>What is the matter with the philosophy? One
has a sense of having come to a sudden, short stop
at the end of an intellectual era. In the crisis,
this philosophy of intelligent control just does
not measure up to our needs. What is the root
of this inadequacy that is felt so keenly by our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
restless minds? Van Wyck Brooks has pointed
out searchingly the lack of poetic vision in our
pragmatist “awakeners.” Is there something in
these realistic attitudes that works actually against
poetic vision, against concern for the quality of
life as above machinery of life? Apparently
there is. The war has revealed a younger intelligentsia,
trained up in the pragmatic dispensation,
immensely ready for the executive ordering of
events, pitifully unprepared for the intellectual
interpretation or the idealistic focusing of ends.
The young men in Belgium, the officers’ training
corps, the young men being sucked into the councils
at Washington and into war-organization
everywhere, have among them a definite element,
upon whom Dewey, as veteran philosopher, might
well bestow a papal blessing. They have absorbed
the secret of scientific method as applied to
political administration. They are liberal, enlightened,
aware. They are touched with creative
intelligence toward the solution of political
and industrial problems. They are a wholly new
force in American life, the product of the swing
in the colleges from a training that emphasized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
classical studies to one that emphasized political
and economic values. Practically all this element,
one would say, is lined up in service of the
war-technique. There seems to have been a peculiar
congeniality between the war and these men.
It is as if the war and they had been waiting for
each other. One wonders what scope they would
have had for their intelligence without it. Probably
most of them would have gone into industry
and devoted themselves to sane reorganization
schemes. What is significant is that it is the technical
side of the war that appeals to them, not the
interpretative or political side. The formulation
of values and ideals, the production of articulate
and suggestive thinking, had not, in their education,
kept pace, to any extent whatever, with
their technical aptitude. The result is that the
field of intellectual formulation is very poorly
manned by this younger intelligentsia. While
they organize the war, formulation of opinion is
left largely in the hands of professional patriots,
sensational editors, archaic radicals. The intellectual
work of this younger intelligentsia is done
by the sedition-hunting Vigilantes, and by the saving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
remnant of older liberals. It is true, Dewey
calls for a more attentive formulation of war-purposes
and ideas, but he calls largely to deaf
ears. His disciples have learned all too literally
the instrumental attitude toward life, and, being
immensely intelligent and energetic, they are making
themselves efficient instruments of the war-technique,
accepting with little question the ends
as announced from above. That those ends are
largely negative does not concern them, because
they have never learned not to subordinate idea to
technique. Their education has not given them a
coherent system of large ideas, or a feeling for
democratic goals. They have, in short, no clear
philosophy of life except that of intelligent service,
the admirable adaptation of means to ends.
They are vague as to what kind of a society they
want, or what kind of society America needs, but
they are equipped with all the administrative attitudes
and talents necessary to attain it.</p>

<p>To those of us who have taken Dewey’s philosophy
almost as our American religion, it never
occurred that values could be subordinated to
technique. We were instrumentalists, but we had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
our private utopias so clearly before our minds
that the means fell always into its place as contributory.
And Dewey, of course, always meant
his philosophy, when taken as a philosophy of life,
to start with values. But there was always that
unhappy ambiguity in his doctrine as to just how
values were created, and it became easier and easier
to assume that just any growth was justified
and almost any activity valuable so long as it
achieved ends. The American, in living out this
philosophy, has habitually confused results with
product, and been content with getting somewhere
without asking too closely whether it was the desirable
place to get. It is now becoming plain
that unless you start with the vividest kind of
poetic vision, your instrumentalism is likely to
land you just where it has landed this younger
intelligentsia which is so happily and busily engaged
in the national enterprise of war. You
must have your vision and you must have your
technique. The practical effect of Dewey’s philosophy
has evidently been to develop the sense
of the latter at the expense of the former.
Though he himself would develop them together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
even in him there seems to be a flagging of values,
under the influence of war. <i>The New Republic</i>
honorably clamors for the Allies to subordinate
military strategy to political ends, technique to
democratic values. But war always undermines
values. It is the outstanding lesson of the whole
war that statesmen cannot be trusted to get this
perspective right, that their only motto is, first to
win and then grab what they can. The struggle
against this statesmanlike animus must be a losing
one as long as we have not very clear and very determined
and very revolutionary democratic ideas
and programmes to challenge them with. The
trouble with our situation is not only that values
have been generally ignored in favor of technique,
but that those who have struggled to keep values
foremost, have been too bloodless and too near-sighted
in their vision. The defect of any philosophy
of “adaptation” or “adjustment,” even when
it means adjustment to changing, living experience,
is that there is no provision for thought or
experience getting beyond itself. If your ideal is
to be adjustment to your situation, in radiant coöperation
with reality, then your success is likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
to be just that and no more. You never transcend
anything. You grow, but your spirit never jumps
out of your skin to go on wild adventures. If
your policy as a publicist reformer is to take
what you can get, you are likely to find that you
get something less than you should be willing to
take. Italy in the settlement is said to be demanding
one hundred in order to get twenty, and
this Machiavellian principle might well be adopted
by the radical. Vision must constantly outshoot
technique, opportunist efforts usually achieve less
even than what seemed obviously possible. An
impossibilist élan that appeals to desire will often
carry further. A philosophy of adjustment will
not even make for adjustment. If you try merely
to “meet” situations as they come, you will not
even meet them. Instead you will only pile up
behind you deficits and arrears that will some day
bankrupt you.</p>

<p>We are in the war because an American Government
practiced a philosophy of adjustment, and
an instrumentalism for minor ends, instead of creating
new values and setting at once a large standard
to which the nations might repair. An intellectual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
attitude of mere adjustment, of mere use
of the creative intelligence to make your progress,
must end in caution, regression, and a virtual failure
to effect even that change which you so clear-sightedly
and desirously see. This is the root of
our dissatisfaction with much of the current political
and social realism that is preached to us.
It has everything good and wise except the obstreperous
vision that would drive and draw all men
into it.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The working-out of this American philosophy
in our intellectual life then has meant an exaggerated
emphasis on the mechanics of life at the
expense of the quality of living. We suffer from
a real shortage of spiritual values. A philosophy
that worked when we were trying to get that material
foundation for American life in which more
impassioned living could flourish no longer works
when we are faced with inexorable disaster and the
hysterias of the mob. The note of complacency
which we detect in the current expressions of this
philosophy has a bad taste. The congruous note
for the situation would seem to be, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
that of robust desperation,—a desperation
that shall rage and struggle until new values come
out of the travail, and we see some glimmering
of our democratic way. In the creation of these
new values, we may expect the old philosophy, the
old radicalism, to be helpless. It has found a
perfectly definite level, and there is no reason to
think that it will not remain there. Its flowering
appears in the technical organization of the war
by an earnest group of young liberals, who direct
their course by an opportunist programme of State-socialism
at home and a league of benevolently
imperialistic nations abroad. At their best they
can give us a government by prudent, enlightened
college men instead of by politicians. At their
best, they can abolish war by making everybody a
partner in the booty of exploitation. That is all,
and it is technically admirable. Only there is
nothing in the outlook that touches in any way
the happiness of the individual, the vivifying of
the personality, the comprehension of social forces,
the flair of art,—in other words, the quality of
life. Our intellectuals have failed us as value-creators,
even as value-emphasizers. The allure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
of the martial in war has passed only to be succeeded
by the allure of the technical. The allure
of fresh and true ideas, of free speculation, of artistic
vigor, of cultural styles, of intelligence suffused
by feeling, and feeling given fiber and outline
by intelligence, has not come, and can hardly
come, we see now, while our reigning philosophy
is an instrumental one.</p>

<p>Whence can come this allure? Only from
those who are thorough malcontents. Irritation
at things as they are, disgust at the continual frustrations
and aridities of American life, deep dissatisfaction
with self and with the groups that
give themselves forth as hopeful,—out of such
moods there might be hammered new values.
The malcontents would be men and women who
could not stomach the war, or the reactionary
idealism that has followed in its train. They are
quite through with the professional critics and
classicists who have let cultural values die through
their own personal ineptitude. Yet these malcontents
have no intention of being cultural vandals,
only to slay. They are not barbarians, but seek
the vital and the sincere everywhere. All they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
want is a new orientation of the spirit that shall
be modern, an orientation to accompany that
technical orientation which is fast coming, and
which the war accelerates. They will be harsh
and often bad-tempered, and they will feel that
the break-up of things is no time for mellowness.
They will have a taste for spiritual adventure, and
for sinister imaginative excursions. It will not be
Puritanism so much as complacency that they will
fight. A tang, a bitterness, an intellectual fiber,
a verve, they will look for in literature, and their
most virulent enemies will be those unaccountable
radicals who are still morally servile, and are now
trying to suppress all free speculation in the interests
of nationalism. Something more mocking,
more irreverent, they will constantly want. They
will take institutions very lightly, indeed will
never fail to be surprised at the seriousness with
which good radicals take the stated offices and systems.
Their own contempt will be scarcely
veiled, and they will be glad if they can tease, provoke,
irritate thought on any subject. These malcontents
will be more or less of the American tribe
of talent who used either to go immediately to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Europe, or starved submissively at home. But
these people will neither go to Europe, nor starve
submissively. They are too much entangled
emotionally in the possibilities of American life
to leave it, and they have no desire whatever to
starve. So they are likely to go ahead beating
their heads at the wall until they are either bloody
or light appears. They will give offense to their
elders who cannot see what all the concern is
about, and they will hurt the more middle-aged
sense of adventure upon which the better integrated
minds of the younger generation will
have compromised. Optimism is often compensatory,
and the optimistic mood in American
thought may mean merely that American life is
too terrible to face. A more skeptical, malicious,
desperate, ironical mood may actually be the sign
of more vivid and more stirring life fermenting
in America to-day. It may be a sign of hope.
That thirst for more of the intellectual “war and
laughter” that we find Nietzsche calling us to
may bring us satisfactions that optimism-haunted
philosophies could never bring. Malcontentedness
may be the beginning of promise. That is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
why I evoked the spirit of William James, with
its gay passion for ideas, and its freedom of
speculation, when I felt the slightly pedestrian
gait into which the war had brought pragmatism.
It is the creative desire more than the creative intelligence
that we shall need if we are ever to fly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII<br />

UNFINISHED FRAGMENT ON THE
STATE</h2>

<p class="ph1">(Winter, 1918)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Government</span> is synonymous with neither
State nor Nation. It is the machinery by which
the nation, organized as a State, carries out its
State functions. Government is a framework of
the administration of laws, and the carrying out
of the public force. Government is the idea of
the State put into practical operation in the hands
of definite, concrete, fallible men. It is the
visible sign of the invisible grace. It is the word
made flesh. And it has necessarily the limitations
inherent in all practicality. Government is the
only form in which we can envisage the State, but
it is by no means identical with it. That the
State is a mystical conception is something that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
must never be forgotten. Its glamor and its significance
linger behind the framework of Government
and direct its activities.</p>

<p>Wartime brings the ideal of the State out into
very clear relief, and reveals attitudes and tendencies
that were hidden. In times of peace the
sense of the State flags in a republic that is not
militarized. For war is essentially the health of
the State. The ideal of the State is that within
its territory its power and influence should be
universal. As the Church is the medium for the
spiritual salvation of men, so the State is thought
of as the medium for his political salvation. Its
idealism is a rich blood flowing to all the members
of the body politic. And it is precisely in
war that the urgency for union seems greatest, and
the necessity for universality seems most unquestioned.
The State is the organization of the
herd to act offensively or defensively against another
herd similarly organized. The more terrifying
the occasion for defense, the closer will become
the organization and the more coercive the
influence upon each member of the herd. War
sends the current of purpose and activity flowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
down to the lowest level of the herd, and to its
most remote branches. All the activities of society
are linked together as fast as possible to this
central purpose of making a military offensive or
a military defense, and the State becomes what
in peace times it has vainly struggled to become—the
inexorable arbiter and determinant of men’s
businesses and attitudes and opinions. The slack
is taken up, the cross-currents fade out, and the
nation moves lumberingly and slowly, but with
ever accelerated speed and integration, towards
the great end, towards that “peacefulness of being
at war,” of which L. P. Jacks has so unforgettably
spoken.</p>

<p>The classes which are able to play an active
and not merely a passive rôle in the organization
for war get a tremendous liberation of activity
and energy. Individuals are jolted out of their
old routine, many of them are given new positions
of responsibility, new techniques must be learnt.
Wearing home ties are broken and women who
would have remained attached with infantile
bonds are liberated for service overseas. A vast
sense of rejuvenescence pervades the significant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
classes, a sense of new importance in the world.
Old national ideals are taken out, re-adapted to
the purpose and used as universal touchstones, or
molds into which all thought is poured. Every
individual citizen who in peace times had no function
to perform by which he could imagine himself
an expression or living fragment of the State becomes
an active amateur agent of the Government
in reporting spies and disloyalists, in raising Government
funds, or in propagating such measures
as are considered necessary by officialdom.
Minority opinion, which in times of peace, was
only irritating and could not be dealt with by law
unless it was conjoined with actual crime, becomes,
with the outbreak of war, a case for outlawry.
Criticism of the State, objections to war, lukewarm
opinions concerning the necessity or the
beauty of conscription, are made subject to ferocious
penalties, far exceeding in severity those
affixed to actual pragmatic crimes. Public
opinion, as expressed in the newspapers, and the
pulpits and the schools, becomes one solid block.
“Loyalty,” or rather war orthodoxy, becomes the
sole test for all professions, techniques, occupations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
Particularly is this true in the sphere of
the intellectual life. There the smallest taint is
held to spread over the whole soul, so that a professor
of physics is <i>ipso facto</i> disqualified to teach
physics or to hold honorable place in a university—the
republic of learning—if he is at all unsound
on the war. Even mere association with
persons thus tainted is considered to disqualify a
teacher. Anything pertaining to the enemy becomes
taboo. His books are suppressed wherever
possible, his language is forbidden. His artistic
products are considered to convey in the subtlest
spiritual way taints of vast poison to the soul
that permits itself to enjoy them. So enemy
music is suppressed, and energetic measures of
opprobrium taken against those whose artistic
consciences are not ready to perform such an act
of self-sacrifice. The rage for loyal conformity
works impartially, and often in diametric opposition
to other orthodoxies and traditional conformities,
or even ideals. The triumphant orthodoxy
of the State is shown at its apex perhaps
when Christian preachers lose their pulpits for
taking more or less literal terms the Sermon on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
the Mount, and Christian zealots are sent to
prison for twenty years for distributing tracts
which argue that war is unscriptural.</p>

<p>War is the health of the State. It automatically
sets in motion throughout society those irresistible
forces for uniformity, for passionate coöperation
with the Government in coercing into
obedience the minority groups and individuals
which lack the larger herd sense. The machinery
of government sets and enforces the drastic penalties,
the minorities are either intimidated into
silence, or brought slowly around by a subtle process
of persuasion which may seem to them really
to be converting them. Of course the ideal of
perfect loyalty, perfect uniformity is never really
attained. The classes upon whom the amateur
work of coercion falls are unwearied in their zeal,
but often their agitation instead of converting,
merely serves to stiffen their resistance. Minorities
are rendered sullen, and some intellectual
opinion bitter and satirical. But in general, the
nation in wartime attains a uniformity of feeling,
a hierarchy of values culminating at the undisputed
apex of the State ideal, which could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
possibly be produced through any other agency
than war. Other values such as artistic creation,
knowledge, reason, beauty, the enhancement of
life, are instantly and almost unanimously sacrificed,
and the significant classes who have constituted
themselves the amateur agents of the
State, are engaged not only in sacrificing these
values for themselves but in coercing all other
persons into sacrificing them.</p>

<p>War—or at least modern war waged by a
democratic republic against a powerful enemy—seems
to achieve for a nation almost all that the
most inflamed political idealist could desire.
Citizens are no longer indifferent to their Government,
but each cell of the body politic is brimming
with life and activity. We are at last on the
way to full realization of that collective community
in which each individual somehow contains
the virtue of the whole. In a nation at
war, every citizen identifies himself with the
whole, and feels immensely strengthened in that
identification. The purpose and desire of the collective
community live in each person who throws
himself whole-heartedly into the cause of war.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
The impeding distinction between society and the
individual is almost blotted out. At war, the individual
becomes almost identical with his society.
He achieves a superb self-assurance, an
intuition of the rightness of all his ideas and
emotions, so that in the suppression of opponents
or heretics he is invincibly strong; he feels behind
him all the power of the collective community.
The individual as social being in war seems to
have achieved almost his apotheosis. Not for any
religious impulse could the American nation have
been expected to show such devotion <i>en masse</i>,
such sacrifice and labor. Certainly not for any
secular good, such as universal education or the
subjugation of nature, would it have poured forth
its treasure and its life, or would it have permitted
such stern coercive measures to be taken against
it, such as conscripting its money and its men.
But for the sake of a war of offensive self-defense,
undertaken to support a difficult cause to the
slogan of “democracy,” it would reach the highest
level ever known of collective effort.</p>

<p>For these secular goods, connected with the enhancement
of life, the education of man and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
use of the intelligence to realize reason and beauty
in the nation’s communal living, are alien to our
traditional ideal of the State. The State is intimately
connected with war, for it is the organization
of the collective community when it acts in
a political manner, and to act in a political manner
towards a rival group has meant, throughout
all history—war.</p>

<p>There is nothing invidious in the use of the
term, “herd,” in connection with the State. It is
merely an attempt to reduce closer to first principles
the nature of this institution in the shadow
of which we all live, move and have our being.
Ethnologists are generally agreed that human society
made its first appearance as the human pack
and not as a collection of individuals or of couples.
The herd is in fact the original unit, and only as
it was differentiated did personal individuality
develop. All the most primitive surviving tribes
of men are shown to live in a very complex but
very rigid social organization where opportunity
for individuation is scarcely given. These tribes
remain strictly organized herds, and the difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
between them and the modern State is one of degree
of sophistication and variety of organization,
and not of kind.</p>

<p>Psychologists recognize the gregarious impulse
as one of the strongest primitive pulls which keeps
together the herds of the different species of higher
animals. Mankind is no exception. Our pugnacious
evolutionary history has prevented the impulse
from ever dying out. This gregarious
impulse is the tendency to imitate, to conform, to
coalesce together, and is most powerful when the
herd believes itself threatened with attack.
Animals crowd together for protection, and men
become most conscious of their collectivity at the
threat of war. Consciousness of collectivity
brings confidence and a feeling of massed strength,
which in turn arouses pugnacity and the battle is
on. In civilized man, the gregarious impulse acts
not only to produce concerted action for defense,
but also to produce identity of opinion. Since
thought is a form of behavior, the gregarious impulse
floods up into its realms and demands that
sense of uniform thought which wartime produces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
so successfully. And it is in this flooding of the
conscious life of society that gregariousness works
its havoc.</p>

<p>For just as in modern societies the sex-instinct is
enormously over-supplied for the requirements of
human propagation, so the gregarious impulse is
enormously over-supplied for the work of protection
which it is called upon to perform. It would
be quite enough if we were gregarious enough to
enjoy the companionship of others, to be able to
coöperate with them, and to feel a slight malaise
at solitude. Unfortunately, however, this impulse
is not content with these reasonable and
healthful demands, but insists that like-mindedness
shall prevail everywhere, in all departments
of life. So that all human progress, all novelty,
and non-conformity, must be carried against the
resistance of this tyrannical herd-instinct which
drives the individual into obedience and conformity
with the majority. Even in the most
modern and enlightened societies this impulse
shows little sign of abating. As it is driven by
inexorable economic demand out of the sphere of
utility, it seems to fasten itself ever more fiercely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
in the realm of feeling and opinion, so that conformity
comes to be a thing aggressively desired
and demanded.</p>

<p>The gregarious impulse keeps its hold all the
more virulently because when the group is in motion
or is taking any positive action, this feeling
of being with and supported by the collective herd
very greatly feeds that will to power, the nourishment
of which the individual organism so constantly
demands. You feel powerful by conforming,
and you feel forlorn and helpless if you are
out of the crowd. While even if you do not get
any access of power by thinking and feeling just
as everybody else in your group does, you get at
least the warm feeling of obedience, the soothing
irresponsibility of protection.</p>

<p>Joining as it does to these very vigorous tendencies
of the individual—the pleasure in power
and the pleasure in obedience—this gregarious
impulse becomes irresistible in society. War
stimulates it to the highest possible degree, sending
the influences of its mysterious herd-current
with its inflations of power and obedience to the
farthest reaches of the society, to every individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
and little group that can possibly be affected.
And it is these impulses which the State—the organization
of the entire herd, the entire collectivity—is
founded on and makes use of.</p>

<p>There is, of course, in the feeling towards the
State a large element of pure filial mysticism.
The sense of insecurity, the desire for protection,
sends one’s desire back to the father and mother,
with whom is associated the earliest feelings of
protection. It is not for nothing that one’s State
is still thought of as Father or Motherland, that
one’s relation towards it is conceived in terms
of family affection. The war has shown that
nowhere under the shock of danger have these
primitive childlike attitudes failed to assert themselves
again, as much in this country as anywhere.
If we have not the intense Father-sense of the
German who worships his Vaterland, at least in
Uncle Sam we have a symbol of protecting, kindly
authority, and in the many Mother-posters of the
Red Cross, we see how easily in the more tender
functions of war-service, the ruling organization
is conceived in family terms. A people at war
have become in the most literal sense obedient,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
respectful, trustful children again, full of that
naïve faith in the all-wisdom and all-power of the
adult who takes care of them, imposes his mild but
necessary rule upon them and in whom they lose
their responsibility and anxieties. In this recrudescence
of the child, there is great comfort, and
a certain influx of power. On most people the
strain of being an independent adult weighs
heavily, and upon none more than those members
of the significant classes who have had bequeathed
to them or have assumed the responsibilities of
governing. The State provides the convenientest
of symbols under which these classes can retain all
the actual pragmatic satisfaction of governing, but
can rid themselves of the psychic burden of adulthood.
They continue to direct industry and government
and all the institutions of society pretty
much as before, but in their own conscious eyes
and in the eyes of the general public, they are
turned from their selfish and predatory ways, and
have become loyal servants of society, or something
greater than they—the State. The man
who moves from the direction of a large business
in New York to a post in the war management<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
industrial service in Washington does not
apparently alter very much his power or his
administrative technique. But psychically, what
a transfiguration has occurred! His is now not
only the power but the glory! And his sense of
satisfaction is directly proportional not to the
genuine amount of personal sacrifice that may be
involved in the change but to the extent to which
he retains his industrial prerogatives and sense of
command.</p>

<p>From members of this class a certain insuperable
indignation arises if the change from private
enterprise to State service involves any real loss
of power and personal privilege. If there is to be
pragmatic sacrifice, let it be, they feel, on the
field of honor, in the traditionally acclaimed
deaths by battle, in that detour to suicide, as
Nietzsche calls war. The State in wartime supplies
satisfaction for this very real craving, but its
chief value is the opportunity it gives for this
regression to infantile attitudes. In your reaction
to an imagined attack on your country or an insult
to its government, you draw closer to the herd for
protection, you conform in word and deed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
you insist vehemently that everybody else shall
think, speak and act together. And you fix your
adoring gaze upon the State, with a truly filial
look, as upon the Father of the flock, the quasi-personal
symbol of the strength of the herd, and
the leader and determinant of your definite action
and ideas.</p>

<p>The members of the working-classes, that portion
at least which does not identify itself with
the significant classes and seek to imitate it and
rise to it, are notoriously less affected by the
symbolism of the State, or, in other words, are
less patriotic than the significant classes. For
theirs is neither the power nor the glory. The
State in wartime does not offer them the opportunity
to regress, for, never having acquired social
adulthood, they cannot lose it. If they have been
drilled and regimented, as by the industrial
régime of the last century, they go out docilely
enough to do battle for their State, but they are
almost entirely without that filial sense and even
without that herd-intellect sense which operates
so powerfully among their “betters.” They live
habitually in an industrial serfdom, by which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
though nominally free, they are in practice as a
class bound to a system of machine-production
the implements of which they do not own, and in
the distribution of whose product they have not
the slightest voice, except what they can occasionally
exert by a veiled intimidation which
draws slightly more of the product in their direction.
From such serfdom, military conscription
is not so great a change. But into the military
enterprise they go, not with those hurrahs of the
significant classes whose instincts war so powerfully
feeds, but with the same apathy with which
they enter and continue in the industrial enterprise.</p>

<p>From this point of view, war can be called
almost an upper-class sport. The novel interests
and excitements it provides, the inflations of
power, the satisfaction it gives to those very
tenacious human impulses—gregariousness and
parent-regression—endow it with all the qualities
of a luxurious collective game which is felt intensely
just in proportion to the sense of significant
rule the person has in the class-division of
his society. A country at war—particularly our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
own country at war—does not act as a purely
homogeneous herd. The significant classes have
all the herd-feeling in all its primitive intensity,
but there are barriers, or at least differentials of
intensity, so that this feeling does not flow freely
without impediment throughout the entire nation.
A modern country represents a long historical and
social process of disaggregation of the herd. The
nation at peace is not a group, it is a network of
myriads of groups representing the coöperation
and similar feeling of men on all sorts of planes
and in all sorts of human interests and enterprises.
In every modern industrial country, there are
parallel planes of economic classes with divergent
attitudes and institutions and interests—bourgeois
and proletariat, with their many subdivisions according
to power and function, and even their
interweaving, such as those more highly skilled
workers who habitually identify themselves with
the owning and the significant classes and strive
to raise themselves to the bourgeois level, imitating
their cultural standards and manners. Then
there are religious groups with a certain definite,
though weakening sense of kinship, and there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
the powerful ethnic groups which behave almost
as cultural colonies in the New World, clinging
tenaciously to language and historical tradition,
though their herdishness is usually founded on
cultural rather than State symbols. There are
even certain vague sectional groupings. All these
small sects, political parties, classes, levels, interests,
may act as foci for herd-feelings. They
intersect and interweave, and the same person may
be a member of several different groups lying at
different planes. Different occasions will set off
his herd-feeling in one direction or another. In a
religious crisis he will be intensely conscious of the
necessity that his sect (or sub-herd) may prevail;
in a political campaign, that his party shall
triumph.</p>

<p>To the spread of herd-feeling, therefore, all
these smaller herds offer resistance. To the
spread of that herd-feeling which arises from the
threat of war, and which would normally involve
the entire nation, the only groups which make
serious resistance are those, of course, which continue
to identify themselves with the other nation
from which they or their parents have come. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
times of peace they are for all practical purposes
citizens of their new country. They keep alive
their ethnic traditions more as a luxury than anything.
Indeed these traditions tend rapidly to
die out except where they connect with some still
unresolved nationalistic cause abroad, with some
struggle for freedom, or some irredentism. If
they are consciously opposed by a too invidious
policy of Americanism, they tend to be strengthened.
And in time of war, these ethnic elements
which have any traditional connection with the
enemy, even though most of the individuals may
have little real sympathy with the enemy’s cause,
are naturally lukewarm to the herd-feeling of the
nation which goes back to State traditions in
which they have no share. But to the natives
imbued with State-feeling, any such resistance or
apathy is intolerable. This herd-feeling, this
newly awakened consciousness of the State, demands
universality. The leaders of the significant
classes, who feel most intensely this State-compulsion,
demand a one hundred per cent.
Americanism, among one hundred per cent. of the
population. The State is a jealous God and will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
brook no rivals. Its sovereignty must pervade
every one, and all feeling must be run into the
stereotyped forms of romantic patriotic militarism
which is the traditional expression of the State
herd-feeling.</p>

<p>Thus arises conflict within the State. War
becomes almost a sport between the hunters and
the hunted. The pursuit of enemies within outweighs
in psychic attractiveness the assault on the
enemy without. The whole terrific force of the
State is brought to bear against the heretics. The
nation boils with a slow insistent fever. A white
terrorism is carried on by the Government against
pacifists, Socialists, enemy aliens, and a milder unofficial
persecution against all persons or movements
that can be imagined as connected with the
enemy. War, which should be the health of the
State, unifies all the bourgeois elements and the
common people, and outlaws the rest. The
revolutionary proletariat shows more resistance to
this unification, is, as we have seen, psychically
out of the current. Its vanguard, as the I. W. W.,
is remorselessly pursued, in spite of the proof that
it is a symptom, not a cause, and its prosecution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
increases the disaffection of labor and intensifies
the friction instead of lessening it.</p>

<p>But the emotions that play around the defense
of the State do not take into consideration the
pragmatic results. A nation at war, led by its
significant classes, is engaged in liberating certain
of its impulses which have had all too little exercise
in the past. It is getting certain satisfactions
and the actual conduct of the war or the condition
of the country are really incidental to the enjoyment
of new forms of virtue and power and
aggressiveness. If it could be shown conclusively
that the persecution of slightly disaffected elements
actually increased enormously the difficulties
of production and the organization of the war-technique,
it would be found that public policy
would scarcely change. The significant classes
must have their pleasure in hunting down and
chastizing everything that they feel instinctively
to be not imbued with the current State-enthusiasm,
though the State itself be actually
impeded in its efforts to carry out those objects
for which they are passionately contending. The
best proof of this is that with a pursuit of plotters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
that has continued with ceaseless vigilance ever
since the beginning of the war in Europe, the
concrete crimes unearthed and punished have
been fewer than those prosecutions for the mere
crime of opinion or the expression of sentiments
critical of the State or the national policy. The
punishment for opinion has been far more ferocious
and unintermittent than the punishment of
pragmatic crime. Unimpeachable Anglo-Saxon
Americans who were freer of pacifist or socialist
utterance than the State-obsessed ruling public
opinion, received heavier penalties and even
greater opprobrium, in many instances, than the
definitely hostile German plotter. A public
opinion which, almost without protest, accepts as
just, adequate, beautiful, deserved and in fitting
harmony with ideals of liberty and freedom of
speech, a sentence of twenty years in prison for
mere utterances, no matter what they may be,
shows itself to be suffering from a kind of social
derangement of values, a sort of social neurosis,
that deserves analysis and comprehension.</p>

<p>On our entrance into the war, there were many
persons who predicted exactly this derangement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
of values, who feared lest democracy suffer more
at home from an America at war than could be
gained for democracy abroad. That fear has been
amply justified. The question whether the
American nation would act like an enlightened
democracy going to war for the sake of high ideals,
or like a State-obsessed herd, has been decisively
answered. The record is written and cannot be
erased. History will decide whether the terrorization
of opinion, and the regimentation of life
was justified under the most idealistic of democratic
administrations. It will see that when the
American nation had ostensibly a chance to conduct
a gallant war, with scrupulous regard to the
safety of democratic values at home, it chose
rather to adopt all the most obnoxious and coercive
techniques of the enemy and of the other countries
at war, and to rival in intimidation and ferocity
of punishment the worst governmental systems of
the age. For its former unconsciousness and disrespect
of the State ideal, the nation apparently
paid the penalty in a violent swing to the other
extreme. It acted so exactly like a herd in its
irrational coercion of minorities that there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
artificiality in interpreting the progress of the war
in terms of the herd psychology. It unwittingly
brought out into the strongest relief the true characteristics
of the State and its intimate alliance
with war. It provided for the enemies of war
and the critics of the State the most telling arguments
possible. The new passion for the State
ideal unwittingly set in motion and encouraged
forces that threaten very materially to reform the
State. It has shown those who are really determined
to end war that the problem is not the
mere simple one of finishing a war that will end
war.</p>

<p>For war is a complicated way in which a nation
acts, and it acts so out of a spiritual compulsion
which pushes it on, perhaps against all its interests,
all its real desires, and all its real sense of values.
It is States that make wars and not nations, and
the very thought and almost necessity of war is
bound up with the ideal of the State. Not for
centuries have nations made war; in fact the only
historical example of nations making war is the
great barbarian invasions into southern Europe,
the invasions of Russia from the East, and perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
the sweep of Islam through Northern Africa
into Europe after Mohammed’s death. And the
motivations for such wars were either the restless
expansion of migratory tribes or the flame of religious
fanaticism. Perhaps these great movements
could scarcely be called wars at all, for war implies
an organized people drilled and led; in fact, it
necessitates the State. Ever since Europe has had
any such organization, such huge conflicts between
nations—nations, that is, as cultural groups—have
been unthinkable. It is preposterous to assume
that for centuries in Europe there would
have been any possibility of a people <i>en masse</i>,
(with their own leaders, and not with the leaders
of their duly constituted State), rising up and
overflowing their borders in a war raid upon a
neighboring people. The wars of the Revolutionary
armies of France were clearly in defense
of an imperiled freedom, and, moreover, they
were clearly directed not against other peoples,
but against the autocratic governments that were
combining to crush the Revolution. There is
no instance in history of a genuinely national
war. There are instances of national defenses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
among primitive civilizations such as the Balkan
peoples, against intolerable invasion by neighboring
despots or oppression. But war, as such, cannot
occur except in a system of competing States,
which have relations with each other through the
channels of diplomacy.</p>

<p>War is a function of this system of States, and
could not occur except in such a system. Nations
organized for internal administration, nations organized
as a federation of free communities,
nations organized in any way except that of a
political centralization of a dynasty, or the reformed
descendant of a dynasty, could not possibly
make war upon each other. They would not
only have no motive for conflict, but they would
be unable to muster the concentrated force to make
war effective. There might be all sorts of
amateur marauding, there might be guerilla expeditions
of group against group, but there could
not be that terrible war <i>en masse</i> of the national
State, that exploitation of the nation in the interests
of the State, that abuse of the national life
and resource in the frenzied mutual suicide, which
is modern war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>It cannot be too firmly realized that war is a
function of States and not of nations, indeed that
it is the chief function of States. War is a very
artificial thing. It is not the naïve spontaneous
outburst of herd pugnacity; it is no more primary
than is formal religion. War cannot exist without
a military establishment, and a military establishment
cannot exist without a State organization.
War has an immemorial tradition and heredity
only because the State has a long tradition and
heredity. But they are inseparably and functionally
joined. We cannot crusade against war
without crusading implicitly against the State.
And we cannot expect, or take measures to ensure,
that this war is a war to end war, unless at the
same time we take measures to end the State in
its traditional form. The State is not the nation,
and the State can be modified and even abolished
in its present form, without harming the nation.
On the contrary, with the passing of the dominance
of the State, the genuine life-enhancing forces of
the nation will be liberated. If the State’s chief
function is war, then the State must suck out of
the nation a large part of its energy for its purely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
sterile purposes of defense and aggression. It devotes
to waste or to actual destruction as much
as it can of the vitality of the nation. No one
will deny that war is a vast complex of life-destroying
and life-crippling forces. If the
State’s chief function is war, then it is chiefly
concerned with coördinating and developing the
powers and techniques which make for destruction.
And this means not only the actual and potential
destruction of the enemy, but of the nation at
home as well. For the very existence of a State
in a system of States means that the nation lies
always under a risk of war and invasion, and the
calling away of energy into military pursuits
means a crippling of the productive and life-enhancing
processes of the national life.</p>

<p>All this organizing of death-dealing energy and
technique is not a natural but a very sophisticated
process. Particularly in modern nations, but also
all through the course of modern European history,
it could never exist without the State. For
it meets the demands of no other institution, it
follows the desires of no religious, industrial, political
group. If the demand for military organization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
and a military establishment seems to come
not from the officers of the State but from the
public, it is only that it comes from the State-obsessed
portion of the public, those groups which
feel most keenly the State ideal. And in this
country we have had evidence all too indubitable
how powerless the pacifically minded officers of
State may be in the face of a State-obsession of the
significant classes. If a powerful section of the
significant classes feels more intensely the attitudes
of the State, then they will most infallibly mold
the Government in time to their wishes, bring it
back to act as the embodiment of the State which
it pretends to be. In every country we have seen
groups that were more loyal than the king—more
patriotic than the Government—the Ulsterites in
Great Britain, the Junkers in Prussia, l’Action
Française in France, our patrioteers in America.
These groups exist to keep the steering wheel of
the State straight, and they prevent the nation
from ever veering very far from the State ideal.</p>

<p>Militarism expresses the desires and satisfies the
major impulse only of this class. The other
classes, left to themselves, have too many necessities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
and interests and ambitions, to concern themselves
with so expensive and destructive a game.
But the State-obsessed group is either able to get
control of the machinery of the State or to intimidate
those in control, so that it is able through use
of the collective force to regiment the other grudging
and reluctant classes into a military programme.
State idealism percolates down through
the strata of society; capturing groups and individuals
just in proportion to the prestige of this
dominant class. So that we have the herd
actually strung along between two extremes, the
militaristic patriots at one end, who are scarcely
distinguishable in attitude and animus from the
most reactionary Bourbons of an Empire, and unskilled
labor groups, which entirely lack the State
sense. But the State acts as a whole, and the class
that controls governmental machinery can swing
the effective action of the herd as a whole. The
herd is not actually a whole, emotionally. But
by an ingenious mixture of cajolery, agitation, intimidation,
the herd is licked into shape, into an
effective mechanical unity, if not into a spiritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
whole. Men are told simultaneously that they
will enter the military establishment of their own
volition, as their splendid sacrifice for their country’s
welfare, and that if they do not enter they
will be hunted down and punished with the most
horrid penalties; and under a most indescribable
confusion of democratic pride and personal fear
they submit to the destruction of their livelihood
if not their lives, in a way that would formerly
have seemed to them so obnoxious as to be
incredible.</p>

<p>In this great herd-machinery, dissent is like
sand in the bearings. The State ideal is primarily
a sort of blind animal push towards military unity.
Any interference with that unity turns the whole
vast impulse towards crushing it. Dissent is
speedily outlawed, and the Government, backed
by the significant classes and those who in every
locality, however small, identify themselves with
them, proceeds against the outlaws, regardless of
their value to the other institutions of the nation,
or to the effect their persecution may have on
public opinion. The herd becomes divided into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the hunters and the hunted, and war-enterprise
becomes not only a technical game but a sport as
well.</p>

<p>It must never be forgotten that nations do not
declare war on each other, nor in the strictest sense
is it nations that fight each other. Much has been
said to the effect that modern wars are wars of
whole peoples and not of dynasties. Because the
entire nation is regimented and the whole resources
of the country are levied on for war, this does not
mean that it is the country <i>qua</i> country which is
fighting. It is the country organized as a State
that is fighting, and only as a State would it possibly
fight. So, literally, it is States which make
war on each other and not peoples. Governments
are the agents of States, and it is Governments
which declare war on each other, acting truest to
form in the interests of the great State ideal they
represent. There is no case known in modern
times of the people being consulted in the initiation
of a war. The present demand for democratic
control of foreign policy indicates how
completely, even in the most democratic of modern
nations, foreign policy has been the secret private<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
possession of the executive branch of the Government.</p>

<p>However representative of the people Parliaments
and Congresses may be in all that concerns
the internal administration of a country’s political
affairs, in international relations it has never been
possible to maintain that the popular body acted
except as a wholly mechanical ratifier of the
Executive’s will. The formality by which Parliaments
and Congresses declare war is the merest
technicality. Before such a declaration can take
place, the country will have been brought to the
very brink of war by the foreign policy of the
Executive. A long series of steps on the downward
path, each one more fatally committing the
unsuspecting country to a warlike course of action
will have been taken without either the people or
its representatives being consulted or expressing
its feeling. When the declaration of war is
finally demanded by the Executive, the Parliament
or Congress could not refuse it without
reversing the course of history, without repudiating
what has been representing itself in the eyes
of the other States as the symbol and interpreter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
of the nation’s will and animus. To repudiate an
Executive at that time would be to publish to the
entire world the evidence that the country had
been grossly deceived by its own Government, that
the country with an almost criminal carelessness
had allowed its Government to commit it to gigantic
national enterprises in which it had no heart.
In such a crisis, even a Parliament which in the
most democratic States represents the common man
and not the significant classes who most strongly
cherish the State ideal, will cheerfully sustain the
foreign policy which it understands even less than
it would care for if it understood, and will vote
almost unanimously for an incalculable war, in
which the nation may be brought well nigh to
ruin. That is why the referendum which was advocated
by some people as a test of American sentiment
in entering the war was considered even by
thoughtful democrats to be something subtly improper.
The die had been cast. Popular whim
could only derange and bungle monstrously the
majestic march of State policy in its new crusade
for the peace of the world. The irresistible State
ideal got hold of the bowels of men. Whereas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
up to this time, it had been irreproachable to be
neutral in word and deed, for the foreign policy of
the State had so decided it, henceforth it became
the most arrant crime to remain neutral. The
Middle West, which had been soddenly pacifistic
in our days of neutrality, became in a few months
just as soddenly bellicose, and in its zeal for
witch-burnings and its scent for enemies within
gave precedence to no section of the country. The
herd-mind followed faithfully the State-mind and,
the agitation for a referendum being soon forgotten,
the country fell into the universal conclusion
that, since its Congress had formally declared
the war, the nation itself had in the most solemn
and universal way devised and brought on the
entire affair. Oppression of minorities became
justified on the plea that the latter were perversely
resisting the rationally constructed and solemnly
declared will of a majority of the nation. The
herd-coalescence of opinion which became inevitable
the moment the State had set flowing the war-attitudes
became interpreted as a pre-war popular
decision, and disinclination to bow to the herd was
treated as a monstrously anti-social act. So that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
the State, which had vigorously resisted the idea
of a referendum and clung tenaciously and, of
course, with entire success to its autocratic and
absolute control of foreign policy, had the pleasure
of seeing the country, within a few months, given
over to the retrospective impression that a genuine
referendum had taken place. When once a
country has lapped up these State attitudes, its
memory fades; it conceives itself not as merely
accepting, but of having itself willed the whole
policy and technique of war. The significant
classes with their trailing satellites, identify themselves
with the State, so that what the State,
through the agency of the Government, has willed,
this majority conceives itself to have willed.</p>

<p>All of which goes to show that the State represents
all the autocratic, arbitrary, coercive,
belligerent forces within a social group, it is a
sort of complexus of everything most distasteful
to the modern free creative spirit, the feeling for
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. War
is the health of the State. Only when the State
is at war does the modern society function with
that unity of sentiment, simple uncritical patriotic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
devotion, coöperation of services, which have always
been the ideal of the State lover. With the
ravages of democratic ideas, however, the modern
republic cannot go to war under the old conceptions
of autocracy and death-dealing belligerency.
If a successful animus for war requires a
renaissance of State ideals, they can only come
back under democratic forms, under this retrospective
conviction of democratic control of
foreign policy, democratic desire for war, and particularly
of this identification of the democracy
with the State. How unregenerate the ancient
State may be, however, is indicated by the laws
against sedition, and by the Government’s unreformed
attitude on foreign policy. One of the
first demands of the more far-seeing democrats in
the democracies of the Alliance was that secret
diplomacy must go. The war was seen to have
been made possible by a web of secret agreements
between States, alliances that were made by Governments
without the shadow of popular support
or even popular knowledge, and vague, half-understood
commitments that scarcely reached the stage
of a treaty or agreement, but which proved binding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
in the event. Certainly, said these democratic
thinkers, war can scarcely be avoided unless this
poisonous underground system of secret diplomacy
is destroyed, this system by which a nation’s
power, wealth and manhood may be signed away
like a blank check to an allied nation to be cashed
in at some future crisis. Agreements which are
to affect the lives of whole peoples must be made
between peoples and not by Governments, or at
least by their representatives in the full glare of
publicity and criticism.</p>

<p>Such a demand for “democratic control of
foreign policy” seemed axiomatic. Even if the
country had been swung into war by steps taken
secretly and announced to the public only after
they had been consummated, it was felt that that
attitude of the American State towards foreign
policy was only a relic of the bad old days and
must be superseded in the new order. The
American President himself, the liberal hope of
the world, had demanded, in the eyes of the world,
open diplomacy, agreements freely and openly
arrived at. Did this mean a genuine transference
of power in this most crucial of State functions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
from Government to people? Not at all.
When the question recently came to a challenge
in Congress, and the implications of open discussion
were somewhat specifically discussed, and the
desirabilities frankly commended, the President let
his disapproval be known in no uncertain way.
No one ever accused Mr. Wilson of not being a
State idealist, and whenever democratic aspirations
swung ideals too far out of the State orbit,
he could be counted on to react vigorously. Here
was a clear case of conflict between democratic
idealism and the very crux of the concept of the
State. However unthinkingly he might have
been led on to encourage open diplomacy in his
liberalizing programme, when its implication was
made vivid to him, he betrayed how mere a tool
the idea had been in his mind to accentuate
America’s redeeming rôle. Not in any sense as a
serious pragmatic technique had he thought of a
genuinely open diplomacy. And how could he?
For the last stronghold of State power is foreign
policy. It is in foreign policy that the State acts
most concentratedly as the organized herd, acts
with fullest sense of aggressive power, acts with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
freest arbitrariness. In foreign policy, the State
is most itself. States, with reference to each
other, may be said to be in a continual state of
latent war. The “armed truce,” a phrase so
familiar before 1914, was an accurate description
of the normal relation of States when they are not
at war. Indeed, it is not too much to say that the
normal relation of States is war. Diplomacy is a
disguised war, in which States seek to gain by
barter and intrigue, by the cleverness of wits, the
objectives which they would have to gain more
clumsily by means of war. Diplomacy is used
while the States are recuperating from conflicts
in which they have exhausted themselves. It is
the wheedling and the bargaining of the worn-out
bullies as they rise from the ground and slowly
restore their strength to begin fighting again. If
diplomacy had been a moral equivalent for war, a
higher stage in human progress, an inestimable
means of making words prevail instead of blows,
militarism would have broken down and given
place to it. But since it is a mere temporary substitute,
a mere appearance of war’s energy under
another form, a surrogate effect is almost exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
proportioned to the armed force behind it. When
it fails, the recourse is immediate to the military
technique whose thinly veiled arm it has been. A
diplomacy that was the agency of popular democratic
forces in their non-State manifestations
would be no diplomacy at all. It would be no
better than the Railway or Education Commissions
that are sent from one country to another with
rational constructive purpose. The State, acting
as a diplomatic-military ideal, is eternally at war.
Just as it must act arbitrarily and autocratically
in time of war, it must act in time of peace in
this particular rôle where it acts as a unit. Unified
control is necessarily autocratic control.
Democratic control of foreign policy is therefore
a contradiction in terms. Open discussion destroys
swiftness and certainty of action. The
giant State is paralyzed. Mr. Wilson retains his
full ideal of the State at the same time that he
desires to eliminate war. He wishes to make the
world safe for democracy as well as safe for
diplomacy. When the two are in conflict, his
clear political insight, his idealism of the State,
tells him that it is the naïver democratic values<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
that must be sacrificed. The world must primarily
be made safe for diplomacy. The State
must not be diminished.</p>

<p>What is the State essentially? The more
closely we examine it, the more mystical and personal
it becomes. On the Nation we can put our
hand as a definite social group, with attitudes and
qualities exact enough to mean something. On
the Government we can put our hand as a certain
organization of ruling functions, the machinery of
law-making and law-enforcing. The Administration
is a recognizable group of political functionaries,
temporarily in charge of the government.
But the State stands as an idea behind them all,
eternal, sanctified, and from it Government and
Administration conceive themselves to have the
breath of life. Even the nation, especially in
times of war—or at least, its significant classes—considers
that it derives its authority, and its purpose
from the idea of the State. Nation and State
are scarcely differentiated, and the concrete, practical,
apparent facts are sunk in the symbol. We
reverence not our country but the flag. We may
criticize ever so severely our country, but we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
disrespectful to the flag at our peril. It is the
flag and the uniform that make men’s heart beat
high and fill them with noble emotions, not the
thought of and pious hopes for America as a free
and enlightened nation.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that the object of emotion is
the same, because the flag is the symbol of the
nation, so that in reverencing the American flag
we are reverencing the nation. For the flag is not
a symbol of the country as a cultural group, following
certain ideals of life, but solely a symbol
of the political State, inseparable from its prestige
and expansion. The flag is most intimately
connected with military achievement, military
memory. It represents the country not in its
intensive life, but in its far-flung challenge to the
world. The flag is primarily the banner of war;
it is allied with patriotic anthem and holiday. It
recalls old martial memories. A nation’s patriotic
history is solely the history of its wars, that
is, of the State in its health and glorious functioning.
So in responding to the appeal of the flag,
we are responding to the appeal of the State, to
the symbol of the herd organized as an offensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
and defensive body, conscious of its prowess and
its mystical herd-strength.</p>

<p>Even those authorities in the present Administration,
to whom has been granted autocratic control
over opinion, feel, though they are scarcely
able to philosophize over, this distinction. It has
been authoritatively declared that the horrid
penalties against seditious opinion must not be
construed as inhibiting legitimate, that is, partisan
criticism of the Administration. A distinction is
made between the Administration and the Government.
It is quite accurately suggested by this
attitude that the Administration is a temporary
band of partisan politicians in charge of the
machinery of Government, carrying out the
mystical policies of State. The manner in which
they operate this machinery may be freely discussed
and objected to by their political opponents.
The Governmental machinery may also be
legitimately altered, in case of necessity. What
may not be discussed or criticized is the mystical
policy itself or the motives of the State in inaugurating
such a policy. The President, it is
true, has made certain partisan distinctions between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
candidates for office on the ground of support
or non-support of the Administration, but
what he meant was really support or non-support
of the State policy as faithfully carried out by the
Administration. Certain of the Administration
measures were devised directly to increase the
health of the State, such as the Conscription and
the Espionage laws. Others were concerned
merely with the machinery. To oppose the first
was to oppose the State and was therefore not
tolerable. To oppose the second was to oppose
fallible human judgment, and was therefore,
though to be deprecated, not to be wholly interpreted
as political suicide.</p>

<p>The distinction between Government and
State, however, has not been so carefully observed.
In time of war it is natural that Government as
the seat of authority should be confused with the
State or the mystic source of authority. You cannot
very well injure a mystical idea which is the
State, but you can very well interfere with the
processes of Government. So that the two become
identified in the public mind, and any contempt
for or opposition to the workings of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
machinery of Government is considered equivalent
to contempt for the sacred State. The State, it
is felt, is being injured in its faithful surrogate,
and public emotion rallies passionately to defend
it. It even makes any criticism of the form of
Government a crime.</p>

<p>The inextricable union of militarism and the
State is beautifully shown by those laws which
emphasize interference with the Army and Navy
as the most culpable of seditious crimes. Pragmatically,
a case of capitalistic sabotage, or a
strike in war industry would seem to be far more
dangerous to the successful prosecution of the war
than the isolated and ineffectual efforts of an individual
to prevent recruiting. But in the tradition
of the State ideal, such industrial interference
with national policy is not identified as a crime
against the State. It may be grumbled against;
it may be seen quite rationally as an impediment
of the utmost gravity. But it is not <i>felt</i> in those
obscure seats of the herd-mind which dictate the
identity of crime and fix their proportional punishments.
Army and Navy, however, are the very
arms of the State; in them flows its most precious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
life-blood. To paralyze them is to touch the very
State itself. And the majesty of the State is so
sacred that even to attempt such a paralysis is a
crime equal to a successful stroke. The will is
deemed sufficient. Even though the individual in
his effort to impede recruiting should utterly and
lamentably fail, he shall be in no wise spared.
Let the wrath of the State descend upon him for
his impiety! Even if he does not try any overt
action, but merely utters sentiments that may incidentally
in the most indirect way cause some one
to refrain from enlisting, he is guilty. The
guardians of the State do not ask whether any
pragmatic effect flowed out of this evil will or
desire. It is enough that the will is present.
Fifteen or twenty years in prison is not deemed
too much for such sacrilege.</p>

<p>Such attitudes and such laws, which affront
every principle of human reason, are no accident,
nor are they the result of hysteria caused by the
war. They are considered just, proper, beautiful
by all the classes which have the State ideal, and
they express only an extreme of health and vigor
in the reaction of the State to its non-friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>Such attitudes are inevitable as arising from the
devotees of the State. For the State is a personal
as well as a mystical symbol, and it can only
be understood by tracing its historical origin.
The modern State is not the national and intelligent
product of modern men desiring to live harmoniously
together with security of life, property
and opinion. It is not an organization which has
been devised as pragmatic means to a desired social
end. All the idealism with which we have been
instructed to endow the State is the fruit of our
retrospective imaginations. What it does for us
in the way of security and benefit of life, it does
incidentally as a by-product and development of
its original functions, and not because at any time
men or classes in the full possession of their insight
and intelligence have desired that it be so. It is
very important that we should occasionally lift
the incorrigible veil of that <i>ex post facto</i> idealism
by which we throw a glamor of rationalization
over what is, and pretend in the ecstasies of social
conceit that we have personally invented and set
up for the glory of God and man the hoary institutions
which we see around us. Things are what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
they are, and come down to us with all their thick
encrustations of error and malevolence. Political
philosophy can delight us with fantasy and convince
us who need illusion to live that the actual
is a fair and approximate copy—full of failings, of
course, but approximately sound and sincere—of
that ideal society which we can imagine ourselves
as creating. From this it is a step to the tacit
assumption that we have somehow had a hand in
its creation and are responsible for its maintenance
and sanctity.</p>

<p>Nothing is more obvious, however, than that
every one of us comes into society as into something
in whose creation we had not the slightest
hand. We have not even the advantage of consciousness
before we take up our careers on earth.
By the time we find ourselves here we are caught
in a network of customs and attitudes, the major
directions of our desires and interests have been
stamped on our minds, and by the time we have
emerged from tutelage and reached the years of
discretion when we might conceivably throw our
influence to the reshaping of social institutions,
most of us have been so molded into the society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
and class we live in that we are scarcely aware
of any distinction between ourselves as judging,
desiring individuals and our social environment.
We have been kneaded so successfully that we approve
of what our society approves, desire what
our society desires, and add to the group our own
passional inertia against change, against the effort
of reason, and the adventure of beauty.</p>

<p>Every one of us, without exception, is born into
a society that is given, just as the fauna and flora
of our environment are given. Society and its
institutions are, to the individual who enters it, as
much naturalistic phenomena as is the weather
itself. There is therefore, no natural sanctity in
the State any more than there is in the weather.
We may bow down before it, just as our ancestors
bowed before the sun and moon, but it is
only because something in us unregenerate finds
satisfaction in such an attitude, not because there
is anything inherently reverential in the institution
worshipped. Once the State has begun to function,
and a large class finds its interest and its
expression of power in maintaining the State, this
ruling class may compel obedience from any uninterested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
minority. The State thus becomes an
instrument by which the power of the whole herd
is wielded for the benefit of a class. The rulers
soon learn to capitalize the reverence which the
State produces in the majority, and turn it into a
general resistance towards a lessening of their
privileges. The sanctity of the State becomes
identified with the sanctity of the ruling class and
the latter are permitted to remain in power under
the impression that in obeying and serving them,
we are obeying and serving society, the nation, the
great collectivity of all of us.</p>

<p>An analysis of the State would take us back to
the beginnings of society, to the complex of religious
and personal and herd-impulses which has
found expression in so many forms. What we
are interested in is the American State as it behaves
and as Americans behave towards it in this
twentieth century, and to understand that, we have
to go no further back than the early English
monarchy of which our American republic is the
direct descendant. How straight and true is that
line of descent almost nobody realizes. Those
persons who believe in the sharpest distinction between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
democracy and monarchy can scarcely appreciate
how a political institution may go through
so many transformations and yet remain the same.
Yet a swift glance must show us that in all the
evolution of the English monarchy, with all its
broadenings and its revolutions, and even with its
jump across the sea into a colony which became
an independent nation and then a powerful State,
the same State functions and attitudes have been
preserved essentially unchanged. The changes
have been changes of form and not of inner spirit,
and the boasted extension of democracy has been
not a process by which the State was essentially
altered to meet the shifting of classes, the extension
of knowledge, the needs of social organization,
but a mere elastic expansion by which the old
spirit of the State easily absorbed the new and
adjusted itself successfully to its exigencies.
Never once has it been seriously shaken. Only
once or twice has it been seriously challenged, and
each time it has speedily recovered its equilibrium
and proceeded with all its attitudes and faiths
reënforced by the disturbance.</p>

<p>The modern democratic State, in this light, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
therefore no bright and rational creation of a new
day, the political form under which great peoples
are to live healthfully and freely in a modern
world, but the last decrepit scion of an ancient and
hoary stock, which has become so exhausted that
it scarcely recognizes its own ancestor, does, in fact
repudiate him while it clings tenaciously to the
archaic and irrelevant spirit that made that ancestor
powerful, and resists the new bottles for
the new wine that its health as a modern society so
desperately needs. So sweeping a conclusion
might have been doubted concerning the American
State had it not been for the war, which has provided
a long and beautiful series of examples of
the tenacity of the State ideal and its hold on the
significant classes of the American nation. War
is the health of the State, and it is during war
that one best understands the nature of that institution.
If the American democracy during wartime
has acted with an almost incredible trueness
to form, if it has resurrected with an almost joyful
fury the somnolent State, we can only conclude
that that tradition from the past has been unbroken,
and that the American republic is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
direct descendant of the early English State.</p>

<p>And what was the nature of this early English
State? It was first of all a mediæval absolute
monarchy, arising out of the feudal chaos, which
had represented the first effort at order after the
turbulent assimilation of the invading barbarians
by the Christianizing Roman civilization. The
feudal lord evolved out of the invading warrior
who had seized or been granted land and held it,
souls and usufruct thereof, as fief to some higher
lord whom he aided in war. His own serfs and
vassals were exchanging faithful service for the
protection which the warrior with his organized
band could give them. Where one invading
chieftain retained his power over his lesser lieutenants,
a petty kingdom would arise, as in
England, and a restless and ambitious king might
extend his power over his neighbors and consolidate
the petty kingdoms only to fall before the
armed power of an invader like William the Conqueror,
who would bring the whole realm under
his heel. The modern State begins when a prince
secures almost undisputed sway over fairly
homogeneous territory and people and strives to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
fortify his power and maintain the order that will
conduce to the safety and influence of his heirs.
The State in its inception is pure and undiluted
monarchy; it is armed power, culminating in a
single head, bent on one primary object, the reducing
to subjection, to unconditional and unqualified
loyalty of all the people of a certain
territory. This is the primary striving of the
State, and it is a striving that the State never
loses, through all its myriad transformations.</p>

<p>When this subjugation was once acquired, the
modern State had begun. In the King, the subjects
found their protection and their sense of
unity. From his side, he was a redoubtable, ambitious,
and stiff-necked warrior, getting the supreme
mastery which he craved. But from theirs,
he was a symbol of the herd, the visible emblem
of that security which they needed and for which
they drew gregariously together. Serfs and villains,
whose safety under their petty lords had
been rudely shattered in the constant conflicts for
supremacy, now drew a new breath under the
supremacy, that wiped out all this local anarchy.
King and people agreed in the thirst for order, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
order became the first healing function of the
State. But in the maintenance of order, the King
needed officers of justice; the old crude group-rules
for dispensing justice had to be codified, a system
of formal law worked out. The King needed
ministers, who would carry out his will, extensions
of his own power, as a machine extends the power
of a man’s hand. So the State grew as a gradual
differentiation of the King’s absolute power,
founded on the devotion of his subjects and his
control of a military band, swift and sure to smite.
Gratitude for protection and fear of the strong
arm sufficed to produce the loyalty of the country
to the State.</p>

<p>The history of the State, then, is the effort to
maintain these personal prerogatives of power, the
effort to convert more and more into stable law the
rules of order, the conditions of public vengeance,
the distinction between classes, the possession of
privilege. It was an effort to convert what was
at first arbitrary usurpation, a perfectly apparent
use of unjustified force, into the taken for granted
and the divinely established. The State moves
inevitably along the line from military dictatorship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
to the divine right of Kings. What had to
be at first rawly imposed becomes through social
habit to seem the necessary, the inevitable. The
modern unquestioning acceptance of the State
comes out of long and turbulent centuries when
the State was challenged and had to fight its way
to prevail. The King’s establishment of personal
power—which was the early State—had to contend
with the impudence of hostile barons, who
saw too clearly the adventitious origin of the
monarchy and felt no reason why they should not
themselves reign. Feuds between the King and
his relatives, quarrels over inheritance, quarrels
over the devolution of property, threatened constantly
the existence of the new monarchical State.
The King’s will to power necessitated for its absolute
satisfaction universality of political control in
his dominions, just as the Roman Church claimed
universality of spiritual control over the whole
world. And just as rival popes were the inevitable
product of such a pretension of sovereignty,
rival kings and princes contended for that dazzling
jewel of undisputed power.</p>

<p>Not until the Tudor régime was there in England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
an irresponsible absolute personal monarchy
on the lines of the early State ideal, governing a
fairly well-organized and prosperous nation. The
Stuarts were not only too weak-minded to inherit
this fruition of William the Conqueror’s labors,
but they made the fatal mistake of bringing out
to public view and philosophy the idea of Divine
Right implicit in the State, and this at a time
when a new class of country gentry and burghers
were attaining wealth and self-consciousness
backed by the zeal of a theocratic and individualistic
religion. Cromwell might certainly, if he
had continued in power, revised the ideal of the
State, perhaps utterly transformed it, destroying
the concepts of personal power, and universal
sovereignty, and substituting a sort of Government
of Presbyterian Soviets under the tutelage of a
celestial Czar. But the Restoration brought back
the old State under a peculiarly frivolous form.
The Revolution was the merest change of
monarchs at the behest of a Protestant majority
which insisted on guarantees against religious
relapse. The intrinsic nature of the monarchy as
the symbol of the State was not in the least altered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
In place of the inept monarch who could
not lead the State in person or concentrate in himself
the royal prerogatives, a coterie of courtiers
managed the State. But their direction was consistently
in the interest of the monarch and of the
traditional ideal, so that the current of the English
State was not broken.</p>

<p>The boasted English Parliament of lords and
commoners possessed at no time any vitality which
weakened or threatened to weaken the State ideal.
Its original purpose was merely to facilitate the
raising of the King’s revenues. The nobles responded
better when they seemed to be giving their
consent. Their share in actual government was
subjective, but the existence of Parliament served
to appease any restiveness at the autocracy of the
King. The significant classes could scarcely rebel
when they had the privilege of giving consent to
the King’s measures. There was always outlet
for the rebellious spirit of a powerful lord in private
revolt against the King. The only Parliament
that seriously tried to govern outside of and
against the King’s will precipitated a civil war
that ended with the effectual submission of Parliament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
in a more careless and corrupt autocracy than
had yet been known. By the time of George III
Parliament was moribund, utterly unrepresentative
either of the new bourgeois classes or of
peasants and laborers, a mere frivolous parody of
a legislature, despised both by King and people.
The King was most effectively the State and his
ministers the Government, which was run in terms
of his personal whim, by men whose only interest
was personal intrigue. Government had been for
long what it has never ceased to be—a series of
berths and emoluments in Army, Navy and the
different departments of State, for the representatives
of the privileged classes.</p>

<p>The State of George III was an example of the
most archaic ideal of the English State, the pure,
personal monarchy. The great mass of the people
had fallen into the age-long tradition of loyalty
to the crown. The classes that might have been
restive for political power were placated by a
show of representative government and the lucrative
supply of offices. Discontent showed itself
only in those few enlightened elements which
could not refrain from irony at the sheer irrationality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
of a State managed on the old heroic lines for
so grotesque a sovereign and by so grotesque a
succession of courtier-ministers. Such discontent
could by no means muster sufficient force for a
revolution, but the Revolution which was due
came in America where even the very obviously
shadowy pigment of Parliamentary representation
was denied the colonists. All that was vital in
the political thought of England supported the
American colonists in their resistance to the
obnoxious government of George III.</p>

<p>The American Revolution began with certain
latent hopes that it might turn into a genuine break
with the State ideal. The Declaration of Independence
announced doctrines that were utterly
incompatible not only with the century-old conception
of the Divine Right of Kings, but also
with the Divine Right of the State. If all governments
derive their authority from the consent
of the governed, and if a people is entitled, at any
time that it becomes oppressive, to overthrow it and
institute one more nearly conformable to their interests
and ideals, the old idea of the sovereignty
of the State is destroyed. The State is reduced to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
the homely work of an instrument for carrying out
popular policies. If revolution is justifiable a
State may be even criminal sometimes in resisting
its own extinction. The sovereignty of the people
is no mere phrase. It is a direct challenge to
the historic tradition of the State. For it implies
that the ultimate sanctity resides not in the
State at all or in its agent, the government, but in
the nation, that is, in the country viewed as a
cultural group and not specifically as a king-dominated
herd. The State then becomes a mere
instrument, the servant of this popular will, or of
the constructive needs of the cultural group. The
Revolution had in it, therefore, the makings of a
very daring modern experiment—the founding of
a free nation which should use the State to effect
its vast purposes of subduing a continent just as
the colonists’ armies had used arms to detach their
society from the irresponsible rule of an overseas
king and his frivolous ministers. The history of
the State might have ended in 1776 as far as the
American colonies were concerned, and the modern
nation which is still striving to materialize itself
have been born.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>For awhile it seemed almost as if the State was
dead. But men who are freed rarely know what
to do with their liberty. In each colony the fatal
seed of the State had been sown; it could not disappear.
Rival prestiges and interests began to
make themselves felt. Fear of foreign States,
economic distress, discord between classes, the inevitable
physical exhaustion and prostration of
idealism which follows a protracted war—all combined
to put the responsible classes of the new
States into the mood for a regression to the State
ideal. Ostensibly there is no reason why the mere
lack of a centralized State should have destroyed
the possibility of progress in the new liberated
America, provided the inter-state jealousy and
rivalry could have been destroyed. But there
were no leaders for this anti-State nationalism.
The sentiments of the Declaration remained mere
sentiments. No constructive political scheme was
built on them. The State ideal, on the other
hand, had ambitious leaders of the financial
classes, who saw in the excessive decentralization
of the Confederation too much opportunity for the
control of society by the democratic lower-class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
elements. They were menaced by imperialistic
powers without and by democracy within.
Through their fear of the former they tended to
exaggerate the impossibility of the latter. There
was no inclination to make the new State a school
where democratic experiments could be worked out
as they should be. They were unwilling to give
reconstruction the term that might have been
necessary to build up this truly democratic
nationalism. Six years is a short time to reconstruct
an agricultural country devastated by a six
years’ war. The popular elements in the new
States had time only to show their turbulence;
they were given no time to grow. The ambitious
leaders of the financial classes got a convention
called to discuss the controversies and maladjustments
of the States, which were making them
clamor for a revision of the Articles of Confederation,
and then, by one of the most successful <i>coups
d’état</i> in history, turned their assembly into the
manufacture of a new government on the strongest
lines of the old State ideal.</p>

<p>This new constitution, manufactured in secret
session by the leaders of the propertied and ruling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
classes, was then submitted to an approval of the
electors which only by the most expert manipulation
was obtained, but which was sufficient to override
the indignant undercurrent of protest from
those popular elements who saw the fruits of the
Revolution slipping away from them. Universal
suffrage would have killed it forever. Had the
liberated colonies had the advantage of the French
experience before them, the promulgation of the
Constitution would undoubtedly have been followed
by a new revolution, as very nearly happened
later against Washington and the Federalists.
But the ironical ineptitude of Fate put the
machinery of the new Federalist constitutional
government in operation just at the moment that
the French Revolution began, and by the time
those great waves of Jacobin feeling reached
North America, the new Federalist State was
firmly enough on its course to weather the gale
and the turmoil.</p>

<p>The new State was therefore not the happy political
symbol of a united people, who in order to
form a more perfect union, etc., but the imposition
of a State on a loose and growing nationalism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
which was in a condition of unstable equilibrium
and needed perhaps only to be fertilized from
abroad to develop a genuine political experiment
in democracy. The preamble to the Constitution,
as was soon shown in the hostile popular vote and
later in the revolt against the Federalists, was a
pious hope rather than actuality, a blessedness
to be realized when by the force of government
pressure, the creation of idealism, and mere social
habit, the population should be welded and
kneaded into a State. That this is what has actually
happened, is seen in the fact that the somewhat
shockingly undemocratic origins of the
American State have been almost completely
glossed over and the unveiling is bitterly resented,
by none so bitterly as the significant classes who
have been most industrious in cultivating patriotic
myth and legend. American history, as far as it
has entered into the general popular emotion, runs
along this line: The Colonies are freed by the
Revolution from a tyrannous King and become
free and independent States; there follow six
years of impotent peace, during which the Colonies
quarrel among themselves and reveal the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
hopeless weakness of the principle under which
they are working together; in desperation the people
then create a new instrument, and launch a
free and democratic republic, which was and remains—especially
since it withstood the shock of
civil war—the most perfect form of democratic
government known to man, perfectly adequate to
be promulgated as an example in the twentieth
century to all people, and to be spread by propaganda,
and, if necessary, the sword, in all unregenerately
Imperial regions. Modern historians reveal
the avowedly undemocratic personnel and
opinions of the Convention. They show that the
members not only had an unconscious economic interest
but a frank political interest in founding a
State which should protect the propertied classes
against the hostility of the people. They show
how, from one point of view, the new government
became almost a mechanism for overcoming the
repudiation of debts, for putting back into their
place a farmer and small trader class whom the
unsettled times of reconstruction had threatened
to liberate, for reëstablishing on the securest basis
of the sanctity of property and the State, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
class-supremacy menaced by a democracy that had
drunk too deeply at the fount of Revolution. But
all this makes little impression on the other legend
of the popular mind, because it disturbs the sense
of the sanctity of the State and it is this rock to
which the herd-wish must cling.</p>

Every little school boy is trained to recite the
weaknesses and inefficiencies of the Articles of
Confederation. It is taken as axiomatic that under
them the new nation was falling into anarchy
and was only saved by the wisdom and energy of
the Convention. These hapless articles have had
to bear the infamy cast upon the untried by the
radiantly successful. The nation had to be strong
to repel invasion, strong to pay to the last loved
copper penny the debts of the propertied and the
provident ones, strong to keep the unpropertied
and improvident from ever using the government
to ensure their own prosperity at the expense of
moneyed capital. Under the Articles the new
States were obviously trying to reconstruct themselves
in an alarming tenderness for the common
man impoverished by the war. No one suggests
that the anxiety of the leaders of the heretofore<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span></p>
unquestioned ruling classes desired the revision of
the Articles and labored so weightily over a new
instrument not because the nation was failing under
the Articles but because it was succeeding only
too well. Without intervention from the leaders,
reconstruction threatened in time to turn the new
nation into an agrarian and proletarian democracy.
It is impossible to predict what would have
been worked out in time, whether the democratic
idealism implicit in the Declaration of Independence
would have materialized into a form of society
very much modified from the ancient State.
All we know is that at a time when the current
of political progress was in the direction of agrarian
and proletarian democracy, a force hostile to
it gripped the nation and imposed upon it a powerful
form against which it was never to succeed in
doing more than blindly struggle. The liberating
virus of the Revolution was definitely expunged,
and henceforth if it worked at all it had to work
against the State, in opposition to the armed and
respectable power of the nation.

<p>The propertied classes, seated firmly in the saddle
by their Constitutional <i>coup d’état</i>, have, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
course, never lost their ascendancy. The particular
group of Federalists who had engineered the
new machinery and enjoyed the privilege of setting
it in motion, were turned out in a dozen years
by the “Jeffersonian democracy” whom their manner
had so deeply offended. But the Jeffersonian
democracy never meant in practice any more than
the substitution of the rule of the country gentleman
for the rule of the town capitalist. The
true hostility between their interests was small as
compared with the hostility of both towards the
common man. When both were swept away by
the irruption of the Western democracy under Andrew
Jackson and the rule of the common man
appeared for awhile in its least desirable forms,
it was comparatively easy for the two propertied
classes to form a tacit coalition against them.
The new West achieved an extension of suffrage
and a jovial sense of having come politically into
its own, but the rule of the ancient classes was not
seriously challenged. Their squabbles over the
tariff were family affairs, for the tariff could not
materially affect the common man of either East
or West. The Eastern and Northern capitalists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
soon saw the advantage of supporting Southern
country gentleman slave-power as against the free-soil
pioneer. Bad generalship on the part of this
coalition allowed a Western free-soil minority
President to slip into office and brought on the
Civil War, which smashed the slave-power and
left Northern capital in undisputed possession of
a field against which the pioneer could make only
sporadic and ineffective revolts.</p>

<p>From the Civil War to the death of Mark
Hanna, the propertied capitalist industrial classes
ran a triumphal career in possession of the State.
At various times, as in 1896, the country had to
be saved for them from disillusioned, rebellious
hordes of small farmers and traders and democratic
idealists, who had in the overflow of prosperity
been squeezed down into the small end of
the horn. But except for these occasional menaces,
business, that is to say, aggressive expansionist
capitalism, had nearly forty years in which to
direct the American republic as a private preserve,
or laboratory, experimenting, developing, wasting,
subjugating, to its heart’s content, in the midst of
a vast somnolence of complacency such as has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
never been seen and contrasts strangely with the
spiritual dissent and constructive revolutionary
thought which went on at the same time in England
and the Continent.</p>

<p>That era ended in 1904 like the crack of doom,
which woke a whole people into a modern day
which they had far overslept, and for which they
had no guiding principles or philosophy to conduct
them about. They suddenly became acutely and
painfully aware of the evils of the society in which
they had slumbered and they snatched at one after
the other idea, programme, movement, ideal, to
uplift them out of the slough in which they had
slept. The glory of those shining figures—captains
of industry—went out in a sulphuric gloom.
The head of the State, who made up in dogmatism
what he lacked in philosophy, increased the confusion
by reviving the Ten Commandments for political
purposes, and belaboring the wicked with
them. The American world tossed in a state of
doubt, of reawakened social conscience, of pragmatic
effort for the salvation of society. The ruling
classes—annoyed, bewildered, harassed—pretended
with much bemoaning that they were losing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
their grip on the State. Their inspired prophets
uttered solemn warnings against political novelty
and the abandonment of the tried and tested fruits
of experience.</p>

<p>These classes actually had little to fear. A political
system which had been founded in the interests
of property by their own spiritual and economic
ancestors, which had become ingrained in
the country’s life through a function of 120 years,
which was buttressed by a legal system which went
back without a break to the early English monarchy
was not likely to crumble before the anger
of a few muck-rakers, the disillusionment of a few
radical sociologists, or the assaults of proletarian
minorities. Those who bided their time through
the Taft interregnum, which merely continued the
Presidency until there could be found a statesman
to fill it, were rewarded by the appearance of the
exigency of a war, in which business organization
was imperatively needed. They were thus able
to make a neat and almost noiseless coalition with
the Government. The mass of the worried middle-classes,
riddled by the campaign against American
failings, which at times extended almost to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
skepticism of the American State itself, were only
too glad to sink back to a glorification of the State
ideal, to feel about them in war, the old protecting
arms, to return to the old primitive robust
sense of the omnipotence of the State, its matchless
virtue, honor and beauty, driving away all the
foul old doubts and dismays.</p>

<p>That the same class which imposed its constitution
on the nascent proletarian and agrarian democracy
has maintained itself to this day indicates
how slight was the real effect of the Revolution.
When that political change was consolidated in
the new government, it was found that there had
been a mere transfer of ruling-class power across
the seas, or rather that a ruling commercial class
in the colonies had been able to remove through
a war fought largely by the masses a vexatious
over-lordship of the irresponsible coterie of ministers
that surrounded George III. The colonies
merely exchanged a system run in the interest of
the overseas trade of English wealth for a system
run in the interest of New England and Philadelphia
merchanthood, and later of Southern slavocracy.
The daring innovation of getting rid of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
a king and setting up a kingless State did not apparently
impress the hard headed farmers and
small traders with as much force as it has their
patriotic defenders. The animus of the Convention
was so obviously monarchical that any executive
they devised could be only a very thinly disguised
king. The compromise by which the presidency
was created proved but to be the means by
which very nearly the whole mass of traditional
royal prerogatives was brought over and lodged in
the new State.</p>

<p>The President is an elected king, but the fact
that he is elected has proved to be of far less significance
in the course of political evolution than
the fact that he is pragmatically a king. It was
the intention of the founders of the Constitution
that he be elected by a small body of notables, representing
the ruling propertied classes, who could
check him up every four years in a new election.
This was no innovation. Kings have often been
selected in this way in European history, and the
Roman Emperor was regularly chosen by election.
That the American President’s term was limited
merely shows the confidence which the founders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
felt in the buttressing force of their instrument.
His election would never pass out of the hands of
the notables, and so the office would be guaranteed
to be held by a faithful representative of upper-class
demands. What he was most obviously to
represent was the interests of that body which
elected him, and not the mass of the people who
were still disfranchised. For the new State
started with no Quixotic belief in universal suffrage.
The property qualifications which were in
effect in every colony were continued. Government
was frankly a function of those who held a
concrete interest in the public weal, in the shape of
visible property. The responsibility for the security
of property rights could safely lie only with
those who had something to secure. The “stake”
in the commonwealth which those who held office
must possess was obviously larger.</p>

<p>One of the larger errors of political insight
which the sage founders of the Constitution committed
was to assume that the enfranchised watch-dogs
of property and the public order would remain
a homogeneous class. Washington, acting
strictly as the mouthpiece of the unified State<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
ideal, deprecated the growth of parties and of factions
which horridly keep the State in turbulence
or threaten to rend it asunder. But the monarchical
and repressive policies of Washington’s own
friends promptly generated an opposition democratic
party representing the landed interests of
the ruling classes, and the party system was fastened
on the country. By the time the electorate
had succeeded in reducing the electoral college to a
mere recorder of the popular vote, or in other
words, had broadened the class of notables to the
whole property-holding electorate, the parties were
firmly established to carry on the selective and refining
and securing work of the electoral college.
The party leadership then became, and has remained
ever since, the nucleus of notables who determine
the presidency. The electorate having
won an apparently democratic victory in the destruction
of the notables, finds itself reduced to
the rôle of mere ratification or selection between
two or three candidates, in whose choice they have
only a nominal share. The electoral college
which stood between even the propertied electorate
and the executive with the prerogatives of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
king, gave place to a body which was just as
genuinely a bar to democratic expression, and far
less responsible for its acts. The nucleus of party
councils which became, after the reduction of the
Electoral College, the real choosers of the Presidents,
were unofficial, quasi-anonymous, utterly
unchecked by the populace whose rulers they
chose. More or less self-chosen, or chosen by local
groups whom they dominated, they provided
a far more secure guarantee that the State should
remain in the hands of the ruling classes than the
old electoral college. The party councils could
be loosely organized entirely outside of the governmental
organization, without oversight by the
State or check from the electorate. They could
be composed of the leaders of the propertied
classes themselves or their lieutenants, who could
retain their power indefinitely, or at least until
they were unseated by rivals within the same
charmed domain. They were at least entirely
safe from attack by the officially constituted electorate,
who, as the party system became more and
more firmly established, found they could vote
only on the slates set up for them by unknown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
councils behind an imposing and all-powerful
“Party.”</p>

<p>As soon as this system was organized into a
hierarchy extending from national down to state
and county politics, it became perfectly safe to
broaden the electorate. The clamors of the unpropertied
or the less propertied to share in the selection
of their democratic republican government
could be graciously acceded to without endangering
in the least the supremacy of those classes
which the founders had meant to be supreme.
The minority were now even more effectually protected
from the majority than under the old system,
however indirect the election might be. The
electorate was now reduced to a ratifier of slates,
and as a ratifier of slates, or a chooser between two
slates, both of which were pledged to upper-class
domination, the electorate could have the freest,
most universal suffrage, for any mass-desire for
political change, any determined will to shift the
class-balance, would be obliged to register itself
through the party machinery. It could make no
frontal attack on the Government. And the party
machinery was directly devised to absorb and neutralize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
this popular shock, handing out to the disgruntled
electorate a disguised stone when it asked
for political bread, and effectually smashing any
third party which ever avariciously tried to reach
government except through the regular two-party
system.</p>

<p>The party system succeeded, of course, beyond
the wildest dreams of its creators. It relegated
the founders of the Constitution to the rôle of doctrinaire
theorists, political amateurs. Just because
it grew up slowly to meet the needs of ambitious
politicians and was not imposed by ruling-class
fiat, as was the Constitution, did it have a
chance to become assimilated, worked into the political
intelligence and instinct of the people, and
be adopted gladly and universally as a genuine
political form, expressive both of popular need
and ruling-class demand. It satisfied the popular
demand for democracy. The enormous sense of
victory which followed the sweeping away of
property qualifications of suffrage, the tangible
evidence that now every citizen was participating
in public affairs, and that the entire manhood democracy
was now self-governing, created a mood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
of political complacency that lasted uninterruptedly
into the twentieth century. The party system
was thus the means of removing political
grievance from the greater part of the populace,
and of giving to the ruling classes the hidden but
genuine permanence of control which the Constitution
had tried openly to give them. It supplemented
and repaired the ineptitudes of the Constitution.
It became the unofficial but real government,
the instrument which used the Constitution
as its instrument.</p>

<p>Only in two cases did the party system seem to
lose its grip, was it thrown off its base by the inception
of a new party from without—in the elections
of Jackson and of Lincoln. Jackson came
in as the representative of a new democratic West
which had no tradition of suffrage qualifications,
and Lincoln as a minority candidate in a time of
factional and sectional strife. But the discomfiture
of the party politicians was short. The
party system proved perfectly capable of assimilating
both of these new movements. Jackson’s insurrection
was soon captured by the old machinery
and fed the slavocracy, and Lincoln’s party became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
the property of the new bonanza capitalism.
Neither Jackson or Lincoln made the slightest deflection
in the triumphal march of the party system.
In practically no other contests has the electorate
had for all practical purposes a choice except
between two candidates, identical as far as
their political rôle would be as representatives of
the significant classes in the State. Campaigns
such as Bryan’s, where one of the parties is captured
by an element which seeks a real transference
of power from the significant to the less significant
classes, split the party, and sporadic third
party attacks merely throw the scale one way or
the other between the big parties, or, if threatening
enough, produce a virtual coalition against
them.</p>

<p>To most of the Americans of the classes which
consider themselves significant the war brought a
sense of the sanctity of the State, which, if they
had had time to think about it, would have seemed
a sudden and surprising alteration in their habits
of thought. In times of peace, we usually ignore
the State in favor of partisan political controversies,
or personal struggles for office, or the pursuit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
of party policies. It is the Government
rather than the State with which the politically-minded
are concerned. The State is reduced to a
shadowy emblem which comes to consciousness
only on occasions of patriotic holiday.</p>

<p>Government is obviously composed of common
and unsanctified men, and is thus a legitimate object
of criticism and even contempt. If your own
party is in power, things may be assumed to be
moving safely enough; but if the opposition is in,
then clearly all safety and honor have fled the
State. Yet you do not put it to yourself in quite
that way. What you think is only that there are
rascals to be turned out of a very practical machinery
of offices and functions which you take
for granted. When we say that Americans are
lawless, we usually mean that they are less conscious
than other peoples of the august majesty
of the institution of the State as it stands behind
the objective government of men and laws which
we see. In a republic the men who hold office are
indistinguishable from the mass. Very few of
them possess the slightest personal dignity with
which they could endow their political rôle; even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
if they ever thought of such a thing. And they
have no class distinction to give them glamor. In
a Republic the Government is obeyed grumblingly,
because it has no bedazzlements or sanctities to
gild it. If you are a good old-fashioned democrat,
you rejoice at this fact, you glory in the
plainness of a system where every citizen has become
a king. If you are more sophisticated you
bemoan the passing of dignity and honor from
affairs of State. But in practice, the democrat
does not in the least treat his elected citizen with
the respect due to a king, nor does the sophisticated
citizen pay tribute to the dignity even when
he finds it. The republican state has almost no
trappings to appeal to the common man’s emotions.
What it has are of military origin, and in
an unmilitary era such as we have passed through
since the Civil War, even military trappings have
been scarcely seen. In such an era the sense of
the State almost fades out of the consciousness of
men.</p>

<p>With the shock of war, however, the State
comes into its own again. The Government, with
no mandate from the people, without consultation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
of the people, conducts all the negotiations, the
backing and filling, the menaces and explanations,
which slowly bring it into collision with some other
Government, and gently and irresistibly slides the
country into war. For the benefit of proud and
haughty citizens, it is fortified with a list of the
intolerable insults which have been hurled towards
us by the other nations; for the benefit of the
liberal and beneficent, it has a convincing set of
moral purposes which our going to war will
achieve; for the ambitious and aggressive classes,
it can gently whisper of a bigger rôle in the destiny
of the world. The result is that, even in those
countries where the business of declaring war is
theoretically in the hands of representatives of
the people, no legislature has ever been known to
decline the request of an Executive, which has
conducted all foreign affairs in utter privacy and
irresponsibility, that it order the nation into battle.
Good democrats are wont to feel the crucial
difference between a State in which the popular
Parliament or Congress declares war, and the State
in which an absolute monarch or ruling class declares war.
But, put to the stern pragmatic test,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
the difference is not striking. In the freest of republics
as well as in the most tyrannical of Empires,
all foreign policy, the diplomatic negotiations
which produce or forestall war, are equally
the private property of the Executive part of the
Government, and are equally exposed to no check
whatever from popular bodies, or the people voting
as a mass themselves.</p>

<p>The moment war is declared, however, the mass
of the people, through some spiritual alchemy, become
convinced that they have willed and executed
the deed themselves. They then with the
exception of a few malcontents, proceed to allow
themselves to be regimented, coerced, deranged in
all the environments of their lives, and turned into
a solid manufactory of destruction toward whatever
other people may have, in the appointed
scheme of things, come within the range of
the Government’s disapprobation. The citizen
throws off his contempt and indifference to Government,
identifies himself with its purposes, revives
all his military memories and symbols, and
the State once more walks, an august presence,
through the imaginations of men. Patriotism becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
the dominant feeling, and produces immediately
that intense and hopeless confusion between
the relations which the individual bears and should
bear towards the society of which he is a part.</p>

<p>The patriot loses all sense of the distinction between
State, nation and government. In our
quieter moments, the Nation or Country forms the
basic idea of society. We think vaguely of a loose
population spreading over a certain geographical
portion of the earth’s surface, speaking a common
language, and living in a homogeneous civilization.
Our idea of Country concerns itself
with the non-political aspects of a people, its ways
of living, its personal traits, its literature and art,
its characteristic attitudes towards life. We are
Americans because we live in a certain bounded
territory, because our ancestors have carried on a
great enterprise of pioneering and colonization, because
we live in certain kinds of communities
which have a certain look and express their aspirations
in certain ways. We can see that our civilization
is different from contiguous civilizations
like the Indian and Mexican. The institutions of
our country form a certain network which affects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
us vitally and intrigues our thoughts in a way that
these other civilizations do not. We are a part
of country, for better or for worse. We have arrived
in it through the operation of physiological
laws, and not in any way through our own choice.
By the time we have reached what are called years
of discretion, its influences have molded our habits,
our values, our ways of thinking, so that however
aware we may become, we never really lose the
stamp of our civilization, or could be mistaken for
the child of any other country. Our feeling for
our fellow-countrymen is one of similarity or of
mere acquaintance. We may be intensely proud
of and congenial to our particular network of
civilization, or we may detest most of its qualities
and rage at its defects. This does not alter the
fact that we are inextricably bound up in it. The
Country, as an inescapable group into which we
are born, and which makes us its particular kind
of a citizen of the world, seems to be a fundamental
fact of our consciousness, an irreducible
minimum of social feeling.</p>

<p>Now this feeling for country is essentially non-competitive;
we think of our own people merely as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
living on the earth’s surface along with other
groups, pleasant or objectionable as they may be,
but fundamentally as sharing the earth with them.
In our simple conception of country there is no
more feeling of rivalry with other peoples than
there is in our feeling for our family. Our interest
turns within rather than without, is intensive
and not belligerent. We grow up and our imaginations
gradually stake out the world we live in,
they need no greater conscious satisfaction for
their gregarious impulses than this sense of a great
mass of people to whom we are more or less attuned,
and in whose institutions we are functioning.
The feeling for country would be an uninflatable
maximum were it not for the ideas of State
and Government which are associated with it.
Country is a concept of peace, of tolerance, of living
and letting live. But State is essentially a
concept of power, of competition; it signifies a
group in its aggressive aspects. And we have the
misfortune of being born not only into a country
but into a State, and as we grow up we learn to
mingle the two feelings into a hopeless confusion.</p>

<p>The State is the country acting as a political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
unit, it is the group acting as a repository of force,
determiner of law, arbiter of justice. International
politics is a “power politics” because it is
a relation of States and that is what States infallibly
and calamitously are, huge aggregations of
human and industrial force that may be hurled
against each other in war. When a country acts
as a whole in relation to another country, or in
imposing laws on its own inhabitants, or in coercing
or punishing individuals or minorities, it is acting
as a State. The history of America as a country
is quite different from that of America as a
State. In one case it is the drama of the pioneering
conquest of the land, of the growth of wealth
and the ways in which it was used, of the enterprise
of education, and the carrying out of spiritual
ideals, of the struggle of economic classes.
But as a State, its history is that of playing a part
in the world, making war, obstructing international
trade, preventing itself from being split to
pieces, punishing those citizens whom society
agrees are offensive, and collecting money to pay
for all....</p>
